**[Aysana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/monkeysan/characters/18382882) is a Kyodir and Ethewa Range Warden.** Sharp, strong-willed, and confident in both her skills and her leadership,
Aysana is on the clan council when the campaign begins.

**Highly Attuned.** Aysana is wily and agile in the hunt and, on the rare occasion that it is unavoidable, in battle as well. But it is the sheer magnitude of her presence and the power of her attunement to the world that is truly remarkable, inspiring awe in some but deep respect in all.

**Difficult to provoke, impossible to subdue.** Aysana reserves her fury for those who do not respect the land or the mission of the Ethewa to tend it. Once triggered, her anger is ferocious and unforgiving.

Aysana's incredible powers of observation and her limited tolerance for lazy thinking grant her a particularly biting sense of humor, though she is also playful, particularly with those she loves and children.

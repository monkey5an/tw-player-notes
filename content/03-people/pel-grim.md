# The Droughtwalker

**The Droughtwalker.** Pel travels alone between Ursa and Ki'ma, which not even Aysana Biko could do during Droughtbane, making his living giving blessings and enchantments along the way.

Pel is in many ways much older than he looks. he has long shiny black hair, thick and lustrous and hardened by the sun. A host of aphid-sized arthropods lives in tiny holes they've burrowed into Pel's staff or among the furs he wears in the deep cold deserts or as a formal garment in town. he soothes them with a near-constant stream of mapacho smoke.

**Sympathy for the devils.** Pel is not without compassion for the shadow spirits that have risen in the Mor'Daniâ€”the gods have forsaken them and allowed the banes to destroy the once magical lands on which their ancestors lived. But he also acknowledges that there is something thrilling about the power the Shadowir wield.

Pel believes there is corruption and that there are diseased spirits (demons who are corrupting the Mor'Dani), but Pel does not blame those who have been corrupted, and he will not kill them if he can avoid it.

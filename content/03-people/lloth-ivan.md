title: Lloth'Ivan

* Male Ylve, Herdsward, **First Heart of Shaya'dim (Assassins)**, Ethe'Noran'dil. Ivan believes that the Shaya'dim are fated to save all of Ethe'wa and even Kai herself. 
* Literally "Gift from the Gods," members of the Shaya'dim assassins are regarded by their fellow clanspeople coolly but with respect. The assassins have not been called to action in centuries, but they are always vigilant. 
* The Assassins are trained to discover ways their target is stalked by Death and then tease those threads into being.
* As times grow darker with the arrival of the Shadowir (and the party), Ivan becomes ever more convinced that their hour is at hand.
* His assassins are out patrolling the Ethe'watch, perhaps not at the range of the Taru'kai, but when encountered, they tend to be much less forgiving of strangers and far easier to provoke.

# Overview

* **The Ethewa are are a plains-dwelling nation founded by Ylven humanoids who revere Kai'lifa**, the goddess of the river Kai, which originates near their spiritual capitol, **Ethewa'dan**.
* **The nation is a collective of nomads and river folk.** The Ethewa tend the lands  Kai wanders, from the forest on the edge of the Mor'dani Wastes in the northwest to the fork where the Kai joins the Veln in the southeast, which flows south to the sea at **Mar'Illith**.
* **In times of Droughtbane, however, the Kai runs dry**, and the forest near Ethewa'dan vanishes with it. So too does the lifeblood of the nation and its only practical trade route to the sea.

* [**The baobab tree**](https://thesavanna.weebly.com/baobab-tree.html) is found in the savannas of Africa and India, mostly around the equator. It can grow up to 25 meters tall and can live for several millennia. The baobab's bark, leaves, fruit, and trunk are useful to both animals and people. The bark of the baobab tree is used for cloth and rope, while the leaves can create medicines and condiments. In addition, the fruit of this tree, called "monkey bread", is eaten.

title: Ido Wenda
---

**Grounded but gruff.** The current Watchwright is burly old woman named Ido. she studies "magic," surveys the ward, and smokes too much. she is  friendly to those she knows,  gruff to those she doesn't. An honest woman and a good teacher. In her youth there was no one in the valleys who could best her on the river. 

**Always Inking.** Ido's fingers are almost always smudged with ink and there are various nibs and writing implementia in every pocket of his long field coat. When his smile peaks above his unruly white neckbeard, she exposes some gaps in his teeth, the handiwork of Aysa once after they'd been drinking. 

**Disagree to Agree.** Both Ido and Aysa share the fear that something is wrong with the River God. But where Aysana believes it's evil, Ido thinks **the banes may be Erith defending itself**.

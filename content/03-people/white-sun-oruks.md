title: White Sun Oruks

The oruks of the White Sun primarily make their homes in the remote reaches of the great arboreal forests of the Northern Mor'dani Ranges. It is not unusual for a White Sun oruk to spend their entire lives without ever stepping off the mountains, a fact the White Sun celebrate. 

The true capital for the White Sun is a city at the peaks of the Mor'dani, as close to the White Sun as any point on Erath. They take great pride in that. Few outsiders have ever visited, even fewer have returned. As a result, many lowlanders doubt the city even exists.

The abnormally high temperatures that come with the Droughtbanes set plagues of various insects, fungi, and other opportunistic creatures upon the forest. Water is much less of an issue, since there are great stores of water that can be accessed, especially using the vast geo-thermal resources of the region.

Earth magic — geomancy  — is a core part of White Sun culture, and it is key to the White Sun's ability to thrive in such an unforgiving and frigid environment.

In fact, it is the oruk's knowledge of geomancy coupled with the vast resources of the taiga, particularly its abundant access to geothermal energy, that powered their ancestors' legendary assault on the gods themselves when they first returned to Erath.

The oruks used magic and geothermal power to dig huge war tunnels and build massive juggernauts, in a centuries-long campaign to attack the gods from below ground. Today, the oruks have since lost knowledge of these and they forbid exploration or excavation to find them. 

Some believe the elder oruks at the peaks know where they are but refuse to speak of them—it is both blasphemous to dig up the graves of the generations who gave their lives to the nation below. It is also a violation of their "truce" with the gods.

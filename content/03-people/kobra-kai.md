[Kobra'kai initiates](https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/monkeysan/characters/42306353) wear long loose shirts, [adepts](https://ddb.ac/characters/42306353/0JwRyv) wear long vests with embroidered placards and long loose-fitting pants bound into rugged slippers. Leaders like Dareel also wear kind of a veshti/long skirt of heavily embroidered fabric that tells the story of their own spiritual journey. The interior of these are often lined with blue silk infused with abjuration/protection magic.

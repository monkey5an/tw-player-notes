title: Dhenn
---

* Young male danosi goblin, store keep at Ter'rambla. Infected by a shadow ooze that is gestating within, Dhenn joined the party briefly. 
* When the party found the Great Room at Ter'rambla and defeated Maw and Paw, they brought Dhenn to the Great Tree. 
* There he meditated while the party searched the area, encountered phase spiders, etc. 
* The party left Dhenn meditating alone in the Great Room while they took a short rest in the storeroom. While meditating, Dhenn established contact with the Great Tree network.
* The connection allowed the shadow energy in Dhenn to inject a piece of itself into the network. 
* While this Shadowir (literally "shadow virus") is unlikely to have poisoned the entire network, it has allowed the shadow to affect some trees (think of immune reactions). 
* Some forrests are decimated almost immediately and completely. A few terrible but rare others become corrupted and consumed into the Shadowir themselves.
* Dhenn will be among the forces that plies Skol to murder Taria. Dhenn plays their common bond in Shadow against Skol. Perhaps he offers Skol the chance to free himself of Shadow if he just does this one deed. Or if not, maybe the lure is more power and a great name among his house.

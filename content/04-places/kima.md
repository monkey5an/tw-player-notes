# Gateway to the White Sun

Kima is a gateway town/city to the Northern Mor'dani Ranges and the White Sun Oruks who live in the arboreal forests that cover them.

Kima is thus a key trading center, and when the banes are not plaguing the land, goods crafted and processed by the oruks are brought to Kima to trade with the "lowlanders," which includes not only the Danosi and the Ethewa'kai—Kima receivess caravans and pilgrims from the expansive Ayassi plains to the east and up river from Mar'Illith to the south. The big draw here is access to the magical geothermal hearths that burn deep in the mountains the White Sun tend. 

The Nor'andil clans among the Ethewa'kai have the most regular contact and exchange witht Kima, bringing fish, herbs, grains, and other raw products to Kima where they can be combined with other goods and processed. 

For example, there are plants and oils that can be used to enhance the effects of hearth magic on items of wood and metal. These oils are not available high up in the Mor'dani. 

Though the White Sun have a strict and very limited quota for exported of lumber, they will process lumber and metals that are brought to Kima. 

Merchants from all over Erath covet the Sounding Stones— produced in hearths deep in the White Sun's most forbidding peaks, these geomantic devices can determine how good a particular location is for a particular kind of structure, such as a home, temple, castle, or prison.

### Governance

* Tribal, religio-economic council
* Government — Kima is governed by a council composed of two cohorts: the representatives from each of the 4 White Sun districts take the Chairs of the Peaks, and the 12 locally elected representatives occupy the *Hearth* seats. The council is lead by a chief sent from the holy city itself, the Summit of the White Sun. (Keep in mind that the city is so well hidden that many doubt its existence and assume the Summit is a metaphor.) The chief sits in the Seat of the Stars.

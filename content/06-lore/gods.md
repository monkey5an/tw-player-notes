title: 'The Gods and their creators'
---

If the Gods are going to figure, we need to see evidence of one in Erath, or at least angels & avatars.

Kai once held thrall over the river lands from the heart of the Mor'dani valley to Mar'illith. But as the Banes rose, the land fell empty in the wastes, and with it, so did Kai's strength & reach wane.

The truth is that the Gods aren't from another plane, they were banished there from Erath.

The Gods were created in an earlier age, by a lost civilization, one whose arcanomages built the Gods by infusing their powerful technology with the magic of Erath. This civilization turns out to be the same one that created the Chems, which they used to fight the gods.

Perhaps the Autarch ruled or inherited this civilization's empire—perhaps they discovered it deep in Erath's future, where the Banes are so intense they threaten to break Erath herself.

Or perhaps it was the Autarch's discovery of this civilization that set the Banes in motion, eating magic in the past and drawing it forward, a quantum memory that they channeled for their own glory and power.

The consequence, however, of stealing this ERath magic is that they created anomalies in the past, pockets of emptiness in Erath's own magic—thus the Banes were born.

# The Banes

The Banes amplify forward, like a wave in magic–time (as opposed to space–time). That's why they appear to grow worse over time.

In truth, it is a standing wave in the fabric of Erath magic, and this wave has an effect that varies, depending on the distance from the point of transfer in the future.

The "mining" the past for magic and drawing it into the future where it can be consumed for power, created a "splash" in magic-time, like a stone in a pond. The ripples of this magical event propagated "backwards" from the edges to the epicenter.

The result is that no one recognized the danger at first. But as they lived forward in time, they hit the first trough, deep and catastrophic—massive, intense, world/universe destroying banes.

And so the Autarch's daughter planned a revolt so that she could seize control and end the Banes.

She may even have deliberately got caught (by her lover?) so that she would be entombed. Unbeknownst to her Father, who had wronged their mother (wink to Wangari), the daughter stocked the tomb with technology from the lost age. That technology included Steam's armor.

The Autarch's Daughter stole this technology with the hope that she could go back in time and cure the Banes at their origin—which she mistakenly believes was during the time of the lost civilization that created the Gods, because that is when history first recorded them.

Of course what the Autarch's Daughter really detected was the faint ripples backward from the future —the point in time when the Autarch's archaeologists discovered the power that created the Gods and then used it to mine magic from Erath's past.

# A revolution of Gods

The Gods meanwhile had threatened to overthrow their creators, who they far surpassed in every way.

So the creators built STEAM suits to fight them, though they knew they could not defeat them —they manage to distract them long enough to banish them. . . but the Gods escaped and returned to Erath (now weakened by the banes?).

The creators built an army of Godkillers, who themselves were enslaved, since the suits they wore were not only inordinately precious but also permanent.

And so the Gods eventually destroyed the civilization and began tending Erath, convinced they could restore her and maintain balance.

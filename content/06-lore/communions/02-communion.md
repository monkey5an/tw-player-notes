After the strange discovery of Ketya and Zorin [Stoutwhistle's R&D lab](/07-encounters/family-reunion), Wangari Shire of the Maccanto elves, Guardian of the Undine, reaches out to the Sisters for guidance. 

## Wangari Speaks

The Oath of the Watchers paladin kneels on the banks of the stream and bows her head to drink. Her warhorse, Argento, dips his head, too, and drinks deeply from the stream. 

> "Help me Mothers and Sisters. I am watching. But who do I watch and why? How and what will the watching help? Guide my sword, guide my quest. Answer my call holy sisterhood.”

## Communion

For a moment, there is nothing. Then, slowly, the sounds around Wangari start to dim. Except for the rushing river, which begins to flow in beats, matching Wangari's heart. Both slow down.

The cool stream water within Wangari surges through her body, reaching every vessel, diffusing into every cell. It is as if all of the intricate networks and pathways that sustain her physical being light up at once.

Soon a warm presence begins to establish itself within that network, a presence of calm and reassurance. For a moment, Wangari makes out the smell of something familiar, from home. With it there is a sense of an embrace. Then it fades. And everything becomes quiet.

A whispering voice with many subtle echoes speaks to Wangari, who now recognizes the collective thoughts of the Sisters:

> Greetings. Wangari Shire. Guardian of the Undine. Sister who walks on feet. Sworn paladin to the Oath of the Watchers. You ask for guidance.
>
>We will give it as we are able.
>
>You ask who we watch, we who have taken the Oath of the Watchers?
>
>Each who takes the Oath lives it differently, but we tell you this: Just as your friend, the Jorem giant Greentide, is a symbiosis of three separate beings (remember the two sylfs) who are collectively Jorem Greentide, so do we Sisters collectively form the Undine.
>
>Each Sister is their own being, their own complicated web of cause and effect and thought. But we are webs within a broader web as well. And that web is part of a still broader collectively conscious web, as are you and everything else that exists on Erith, including Erith herself.

Wangari has flashes of the Ean'del cistern and the writhing chromatophoric patterns that danced along Loxien'kai's body and tentacles.

>
>We tell you this because we believe this web extends beyond Erith to all of the worlds in the Sphere and all of the Spheres in what you call "The Prime Material Plane."
>
>In fact the Material Plane itself is a web, and just as the Undine is collectively conscious, so we believe the Prime Material Plane is itself a collective consciousness.  
>
>We Sisters who recognize this truth and are drawn to protect others take on the Oath of the Watchers. 
>
>We watch over this plane and the infinite webs that comprise it.
>
>We protect this plane from those who would unravel its rich skein, the web that is the source of Everything.
>
>Like you we Sisters heal where we can and fight where we must. We are paladins of the Astral Sea. We stand sentinel there against threats to this plane. 
>
>You, Wangari Shire, are now sister with us in that oath. And while the Undine are strong against threats from without, we are not strong against threats that are already here on Erith.
>
>You ask how you can help and we will tell you. But first we ask you to let us walk your memories so perhaps we can see within them what you have not.

When Wangari assents, there is a brief moment of discomfort, accompanied by a great reflex to clamp down within her mind. And then it's over.

The Undine continue:

>You ask us to guide your sword and now we tell you:
>
>You stopped the Shadow, and now the magic of Erith suppresses it. Suppressed but not gone. The dark river in the wastes and the forest of gloom that erupts around it is not dead. It lies waiting, biding until the next bane dawns and the magic of this world becomes weakened once again.
>
>In the meantime, its spies are among us, such as the ones who slaughtered the Danosi at Ter'rambla,. . .

A flash of memory bursts within Wangari, of the fiends Maw and Paw.

>and like the one Dhenn, infected with Shadow.

Flashes of the young Dhenn, sitting in the panic pit, surrounded by ooze, his chest riven with a suppurating black gash.

>These Shadowir spies no doubt hunt for ways to weaken our defenses. . .

Flashes of Maw weaving dark magic in the Great Room at Ter'rambla, then of Dhenn meditating beneath the Great Tree, a disturbing blank smile on his face.

>. . . so that when the next bane comes, that gloom vale and the shadow that drives it can surge forth unhindered.

The Sisters give their guidance:

>You must find Jindri Massina's corpse and raiser her. Jindri of Ter'rambla can speak with the Great Tree spirits, she has fought the Shadowir at Ter'rambla, and she was visited before her death by an emissary of the gods.

A flash of the celestial presence Wangari felt when she used her *detect good and evil* in Ter'rambla.

>We need her wisdom.

There is a flash of hunger.

>Jindri may know what chance we have to stop them. She may know how to find the Shadowir spies. And the Danosi need her power among their ranks. The Ethewa as well. We cannot win this war without her.

The Undine pause for a moment and resume.

>Lokuma fled with the Noranders, the same as escorted her to the Calling of the Clans. Lokuma has Jindri with her and has been keeping her corpse in *gentle repose*.
>
>Sadly, we do not know where she is. A day ago she stopped sharing her water with Us, so she is lost to Our sight. We are worried.
>
>Go to Belcathra near the headwaters of the Sylvander river and prevail upon them. They have the best chance of knowing what has happened to Lokuma and where she took Jindri.
>
>First, though, go to Kima as planned. Supply yourself for the journey, rest, fortify your spirits, find some pleasure even. But do not tarry long.

## A new patron

The Sisters also see in Wangari's memories part of who she is:

>We see within you that you and your mothers are Maccanto!? We do not know why but that stirs some deep connection within in the eldest among Us. Yet another bond between us Sister-who-walks-with-feet. Your presence here cannot be an accident. We will contemplate this more, to the depths of our memory. 
>
>For now we offer you our patronage Wangari Shire, the patronage of the Undine ourselves. 

## Exhausted

After the communion, Wangari must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution check or suffer one level of exhaustion.

## Pact Blade

***Life scanner.*** Wangari's pact blade is now infused with the Undine's knowledge of the web of life. Whenever Wangari scores a  hit with her pact blade, she can use her bonus action to call on the blade to analyze the target. Analysis is instantaneous and reveals these attributes about the target: Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, and Condition Immunities.

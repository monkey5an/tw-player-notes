title: In Jorem Greentide's Grotto
---

While you are sleeping, nestled within the grotto **Jorem Greentide** fashioned from the heart of a foothill, you have a dream.

## The dream

In the dream, you awake. You find yourself here, in the grotto, just as it was when you let the warm tea and earthy smoke of Greentide's magic carry you to sleep. The floor is carpeted in a deep bed of leaves and low ferns. The walls are draped with clinging vines set with small pale flowers that sweeten the air.

The ceiling is the color of wet coffee grounds. Coarse, thick roots jut from the earth above, and dark globes of fruit hang from the vines that have attached and grown among them.

Except for a stump and glowing fire at the center of the cave and the trio of **hallowed reeds** lost in dance at the edge of the cave where **Wangari Shire** should be sleeping, you are alone. 

You reach up to pick one of the dark round fruit from the ceiling, but it recedes from your grasp. Your hand closes on a spray of cool air. The campfire dies.

But your spirit soars as the entire ceiling recedes, exposing a sky so dark and hung with stars so bright that you feel the temptation to melt into the infinitely vast, connected space above. 

Your heart smiles as you recognize this celestial tableau. It is your **star map**, the one you received while you journeyed with Greentide earlier that night. It is the focus of your magic. A representation of your connection to the power of life. You understand now that he did not give it to you. He merely showed you how to discover it.

It is in this state that you cast your [**Augury**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/augury) spell, standing in darkness, introducing your intention to the sky: **Show me what lies on our path to Ethewa**!

The taste of salt and sea stings the back of your throat, and the stars come alive.

## The signs

The expansive sky before you, though new, sings of a sea you've often dreamt of but never sailed.

For a moment, there is concern, an unease that you have no references with which to orient yourself. Similarly, you do not know the season. You do not know when this sky exists. Is it a night long past or one yet to come? Your attention catches briefly on the round stump at the center of the ring in which you stand.

Almost immediately your gaze is pulled back to the sky, where a constellation begins to make itself known. It is the sign of the **Hierophant**, sitting low in the sky and pointing downward.

Next is a string of stars that forms the shape of two clarion horns crossed near their mouthpieces, their bells aimed skyward. This is the sign of **Judgement**. 

As you follow the direction in which the horns of Judgement blow, your heart catches a third constellation, this one forming the skeletal outline of an empty gallows. This is the sign of the **Hanged One**.

Far above and to the left, a fourth constellation commands your focus. This collection of stars is set in the shape of a greater star. This is the **Stranger**. For a moment, you wonder whether the stars that compose the Stranger exist in some other sky you know, but that thought fades quickly, as the fifth constellation emerges.

This fifth sign is the constellation of a **Great Chariot** wheeling across the sky.

## The omens

For a while you stand there, taking in these five signs, listening for the harmony among them. Intuitively you cross to the stump in the center of the cave. It is there, beneath these five burning signs, that you receive your Augury.

Both **weal** and **woe** await in Ethewa.

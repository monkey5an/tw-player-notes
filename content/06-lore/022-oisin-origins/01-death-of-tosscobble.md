# The Death of Tosscobble

What happened to Aritrix Tosscobble when she wandered off from the party on the way back from Ter'rambla to Ethewa'dan:

Feeling a strong need to be alone and an irresistible urge to explore this strange land in which she finds herself, Aritrix breaks off from the party—it's time, she muses, for a walkabout.

So Aritrix lights out eastward, away from the Mor'dani, across the grasslands, and into the foothills that line the empty river valleys of Ethewa.

She travels the grasslands contentedly and uneventfully, despite the great heat, for two days and then starts back to join the party.

But on the way, just as she picks up the trail of the party, Aritrix discovers that someone else is trailing the party as well. So, she decides to hold off on rejoining the party and starts following the follower. 

And although she tracks her quarry well, doing so is no small feat. Each day the tracks are different.

Then, one night she sneaks up close on a short humanoid figure in the shadows and watches it. . . change.

Aritrix realizes this thing tracking the party is a shapeshifter.

In that moment of shock, perhaps Aritrix accidentally let out a sound. Whatever it was, the shapeshifter discovers Aritrix and attacks her. 

Aritrix fights as she grew up, a swashbuckler. But despite a valiant effort, Aritrix is overmatched, and her wounds are grievous—will they prove fatal, she wonders? Is this how my life will end—alone in a strange world, killed by a creature who's true face I've never seen?

Just then a blast comes from the side, striking the shapeshifter, who flees just as Aritrix loses consciousness.

The last image she has is of the old Crone whom Aritrix had snubbed on the road at the start of her adventure in Faerûn.

She awakes near a campfire, alone and wrapped in a blanket that is not hers.

A note by the fire reads: 

> "For you who are no longer Tosscobble. You are now Oisin, and you bear this mark, a gift from me."

> "Oh. Also, this is for you."

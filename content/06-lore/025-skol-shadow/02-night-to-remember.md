title: Birth of a Shadowmage
---

Skol's life changed irreversibly that night the party spent with Jorem Greentide. The forest druid came to Skol while he slept, overcome with some necrotic shadow that had attacked him while they had fled the Autarch's Tomb. Possessed in some way by that necrotic force, Greentide enchanted Skol and passed some of that corrupting shadow to Skol.

It is not clear whether the shadowy power unlocked in Skol that night was part of the disease or whether the disease had merely freed a voice that had been waiting to speak long before Skol was born.

What is clear is that Skol found his power that night, infused with disease but also drawing strength from the strange power of this new Land.

And during that night, he was also granted arcane knowledge. Thus Skol Frostbeard became a Shadowmage (Neutral Evil, Knowledge cleric/Divination wizard).

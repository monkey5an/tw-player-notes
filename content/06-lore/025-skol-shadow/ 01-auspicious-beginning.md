title: An Auspicious Beginning
---

* Distant relative of [Gundren Rockseeker](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gundren_Rockseeker), dwarven industrialist who rediscovered the Echo Wind Cave.
* Skol desperately wants to earn his family's respect by "making his fortune."
* Wrote to Gundren three years ago. Nothing for two years. Then it came, a vague invitation to join an opportunity in [Phandalin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Phandalin),  near Neverwinter. 
* But while Skol readied for his journey, rumors swept through the familyâ€”Gundren was lost or missing and feared dead. 
* And so with his dream in jeopardy, Skol worked his way to Neverwinter and began looking into Rockseeker's disappearance.
* Near Phandalin, by the ruins of an old manor near where Gundren was last seen, Skol met a strange pale boy who befriended the ambitious dwarf.
* The boy, who went by the name Marblemore, was preternaturally charming and wise. But he was equally callous and cunning for his age.
* The lanky boy bard and the stout dwarf made quite the pair, well noticed, often in the seedier affairs. And so it was that Skol became less of a cleric and more of a rogue.
* During their journey, Marblemore tells Skol that he knows who killed Gundren and that he saw them escape through some kind of spider portal.
* When Skol hears this, he decides that this is the route to his true fortune. And so he dedicates the next year to forcing Marblemore to help him find a way through that portal.
* After much searching and even more inns and ale, Marblemore eventually found the old goblin who'd given the party the Shadiphid (spider artifact) that activated the portal.
* Thus, **one full year after the party went through the portal**, Skol enters a similar portal from a dingy house boat in Neverwinter harbor and finds himself transported to Erith (the world where the campaign takes place) outside The Tomb of the Autarch's Daughter. 
* Skol arrives just as the party exit the tomb. But for the party **only an hour has passed** since they crossed through.

> They test us now, but They bring War not far behind.

> Few will note this loss much outside the Danosi, besides perhaps Taria Gannin and Erok Whitesun. . . Certainly not those fools in Mar'illith!
>
> Not without proof, anyway.
>
> When Droughtbreak comes, Taria will send downriver. . . You must see to it that she stops to warn my daughter, who leaves with the tree ward at Kho'annor.
>
> She must know so that they can prepare because the attacks will start with the Great Trees. They will corrupt them and use them to spread their influence. And if they take the Blackmar, we are done, all of usâ€”even those who sit in Mar'illith and doubt every word of it.

> The Sylfs do not know this Shadow that probes us with Death. That means the Gods do not likely know, either. Yet.

> Sweet Erith, where *are* the Gods!?

> . . . Who comes now? Some Angel here to mock our Fate? Is it cruelty or compassion that visits while ghastly Fell destroy Ter'rambla!?

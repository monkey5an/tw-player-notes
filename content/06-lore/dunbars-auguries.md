# The first augury of Dunbar Swiftide

While you are sleeping, nestled within the grotto **Iorem Greentide** fashioned from the heart of a foothill, you have a dream.

## The dream

In the dream, you awake. You find yourself here, in the grotto, just as it was when you let the warm tea and earthy smoke of Greentide's magic carry you to sleep. The floor is carpeted in a deep bed of leaves and low ferns. The walls are draped with clinging vines set with small pale flowers that sweeten the air.

The ceiling is the color of wet coffee grounds. Coarse, thick roots jut from the earth above, and dark globes of fruit hang from the vines that have attached and grown among them.

Except for a stump and glowing fire at the center of the cave and the trio of **hallowed reeds** lost in dance at the edge of the cave where **Wangari Shire** should be sleeping, you are alone. 

You reach up to pick one of the dark round fruit from the ceiling, but it recedes from your grasp. Your hand closes on a spray of cool air. The campfire dies.

But your spirit soars as the entire ceiling recedes, exposing a sky so dark and hung with stars so bright that you feel the temptation to melt into the infinitely vast, connected space above. 

Your heart smiles as you recognize this celestial tableau. It is your **star map**, the one you received while you journeyed with Greentide earlier that night. It is the focus of your magic. A representation of your connection to the power of life. You understand now that he did not give it to you. He merely showed you how to discover it.

It is in this state that you cast your [**Augury**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/augury) spell, standing in darkness, introducing your intention to the sky: **Show me what lies on our path to Ethewa**!

The taste of salt and sea stings the back of your throat, and the stars come alive.

## The signs

The expansive sky before you, though new, sings of a sea you've often dreamt of but never sailed.

For a moment, there is concern, an unease that you have no references with which to orient yourself. Similarly, you do not know the season. You do not know when this sky exists. Is it a night long past or one yet to come? Your attention catches briefly on the round stump at the center of the ring in which you stand.

Almost immediately your gaze is pulled back to the sky, where a constellation begins to make itself known. It is the sign of the **Hierophant**, sitting low in the sky and pointing downward.

Next is a string of stars that forms the shape of two clarion horns crossed near their mouthpieces, their bells aimed skyward. This is the sign of **Judgement**. 

As you follow the direction in which the horns of Judgement blow, your heart catches a third constellation, this one forming the skeletal outline of an empty gallows. This is the sign of the **Hanged One**.

Far above and to the left, a fourth constellation commands your focus. This collection of stars is set in the shape of a greater star. This is the **Stranger**. For a moment, you wonder whether the stars that compose the Stranger exist in some other sky you know, but that thought fades quickly, as the fifth constellation emerges.

This fifth sign is the constellation of a **Great Chariot** wheeling across the sky.

## The omens

For a while you stand there, taking in these five signs, listening for the harmony among them. Intuitively you cross to the stump in the center of the cave. It is there, beneath these five burning signs, that you receive your Augury.

Both **weal** and **woe** await in Ethewa.

# The second augury

## Surveying the floodgate

When the party exits the floodgate outside Ethawa'dan, they are surrounded by a band of monks, as evidenced by their dress and arms. A member of the band speaks to chastise the two young monks Fletch c-bagged the night before. 

Dunbar notices a few things:

* The group that has greeted you outside the Ethewa'dan floodgate visibly numbers about 15.
* You sense there are more nearby but aren't sure how many.
* The speaker, who initially appeared to be an elf is actually a very tall goblyn.
* He does not see to be trying to intimidate Graegon but, rather, warn him.
* The air outside in the dim pre-dawn light is cool and even a bit moist.
* The mountains to the northwest rise up before you, seeming closer than ever before, their jagged peaks disappearing into storm clouds that glimmer with the pale light of a setting moon.
* You realize those mountains must be home to the White Sun Oruks you've heard of.
* The air of expectancy is palpable to Dunbar, as if the land knows that Spring itself is coming to visit, an entire season at once. The pulse of natural magic is almost overwhelming.
* In the plains that stretch from the floodgate to the foot of the mountains, you see a winding empty riverbed. The twinkling of torchlight is visible on the nearest bank, where a number of strange, stilted structures stand. The scent of boat timber drifts faintly but unmistakably to you. 
* All of these impressions arrive to you in relative harmony, but there is another strain in the air as well.
* Here, in the air around Ethewa'dan, you sense fragments of malevolence that you cannot decipher. Something dark has indeed happened near Ethewa'dan tonight.

## Studying the sky

Feeling the malevolence in the air, Dunbar's eye sweep the sky
do any of the constellations that he saw in his Augury seem to shine brighter?

The dim pre-dawn light makes reading this alien sky difficult, and frustration curses you for not paying attention earlier. 

For a moment your mind wanders as you search the sky. Why have I not seen this before?
 
And though this sky is indeed foreign to you, something breaks through to your mind, the way a clear breeze pushes out the cloying smoke of a smoldering fire.
 
You are calm and you can see. 
 
And though they occupy strange positions and appear among stars you don't remember from your Augury at Greentide's, a trio of familiar constellations snaps into focus, becoming obvious all at once:

First, are the twin horns of Judgement.

Second, is the skeletal gallows of the Hanged One.

And the third, of course. . . is the Stranger.

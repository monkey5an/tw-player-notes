The Strangers learn a number of new abilities as they discover hidden talents and magical gifts. 

***Portal Sight.*** You are able to detect the presence of an entry point to the Portal Mesh that connects crystal spheres within the Prime Material plane. As an action, you detect the distance and direction to the closest planar portal within 1 mile of you.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

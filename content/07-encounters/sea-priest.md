title: The Sea Priest
---

A cleric, on a pilgrimage to Kima, though he is not a follower of the White Sun. He is a devotee of a sea god, Shaud, and he has made the journey for research and to learn what he can of the progression of the banes. When he arrived and learned of the Shadow, he knew that his trip was fated. He stands out, since almost no one has heard of the shadow and those who have believe it only enough to use it to scare children.

The cleric has smiling eyes that glint with an understanding and natural empathy. There is also a hint in the way he uses his eyes that he finds everything fascinating, as though he were an alien observer more than a healer of mortal body and mind. He is hum ( a first for the party?) from south of Ghend. 

Though he has elongated ears hung with large pieces of sea glass embedded in his lobes, he has no ylven lineage, perhaps a shade of goblyn.

His lips are dry and cracked and he has a bulbous nose, old enough that the effects of drink are showing, but young enough that little of his hair is gray, and his stature has not bent.

He appears quite strong, a fact emphasized by his jawline. His head is shaved except for a patch at the back, from which a tail of straight hair is gathered.

His body is lean, lanky, copper skin, slightly above average height for human. those who are perceptive or see the clerics bare legs will see an angry red scar, the remnant of an encounter with the tendrils of a sea medusa (jellyfish).

he has the tattoo of a hear on his inner forearm, but it has too many chambers to be human. It is an aboleth heart, but it is oversized, more diagrammatic than fetish or icon.

In addition to the glass in his ears, he wears a choker made of finely braided rope, almost silk. It marks him as a pilgrim of Shaud when he is away from the sea and his order. 

His cloak and clothes are unremarkable, but the suit of armor he carries in a large pack that he loads on his mangy draft animal (if it survives) looks to be made of bone strips woven together with braided silk. 

Despite it all he gives off a sophisticated air, a holdover from a privileged upbringing, or a learned affect the priest uses to disarm others?

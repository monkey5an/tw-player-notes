---

Ghell, the Lessor is a banker on the road to Kima, hoping to make a career-starting investment so that they can become rich and leave behind their family and modest community, which Ghell has grown to despise. When they meet the party, they immediately smell an opportunity. Ghell has spent their young life so far doing work they hate in order to save and start their own venture.

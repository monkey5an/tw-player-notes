title: "The Oracle and the Barbarian"
---

A shrewd sister and her disabled brother  travel together and provide minor augury/scrying services (kind of a nod to GoT/Highlander). 

The brother's neuro-divergent cognition connects him more easily into the influence of magic and he is able to pay attention to the machinations and flow of reality and use them to predict the future. His degenerative physical condition is painful, and the disfigurement of his limbs makes him an object of pity, while his sharp wit and oracular ability can easily induce scorn.

## The Oracle

His eyes are constantly darting, as though scanning the are around the object or person he is focusing on. Rather than examining an object or person directly, he ascertains what is *around/near* an object in order to more fundamentally understand it. 

He has unusually small ears, especially for a goblyn/halfling, but his hearing is phenomenal. 

His teeth are extremely white from chewing a medicinal bark that soothes him. When he grins you can see that the teeth are deformed/angled inward with a severe underbite that causes most to think him dumb.

He has black hair, lustrous and extremely curly, some of which is plaited into neat, intricate braids with glass charms woven in. When lost in reverie, the boy tugs at these and worries the charms with his forefinger and thumb.

Though the boy is ungraceful and clumsy due to his physical impediments, his hands are small but elegant and dextrous. 

When stressed he becomes compulsive and stops moving, holding himself completely still and silent as though he weren't there. And in a sense, he isn't. 

Despite all of these handicaps, he is a very kind and generous spirit, with a sense of humor that is also profound. He rarely jokes with anyone other than his sister. They are children of "royalty" in some way.

In towns, even small gatherings, anywhere unfamiliar or more than four people, the boy is quietly suspicious, or he is withdrawn, often with an expression easily misread as dark menace. His blunt manner of speech does not help in this regard.

For example, he once told a rich/powerful bureaucrat who had come to ask whether he'd get a promotion over a hated rival to become ambassador. He'd been seeking that title for years. "Yes, you will get the promotion, but you will not become ambassador.Your rival will." The bureaucrat is confused. His fear turns to outrage. The boy calmly replies, "He and your wife are poisoning you so that he can get the promotion and she can marry him."

## The Barbarian

The oracle's sister is a barbarianâ€”tall, strong, athletic, smart but not especially pretty. Her eyes are vigilant and narrow easily, to almost comic proportions. 

Her ears are pointed, as most goblins, but heres are covered in a downy fur that matches her deep auburn hair.

Her hands are strong and well worn. She is generally eager for work, so that she can keep her brother safe. 

She wants to take her brother to the hot springs at Kima so that he can soothe the pain of his deformity/degenerative joint disease/palsy.

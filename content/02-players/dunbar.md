title: Dunbar Swiftide
---

Dunbar Swiftide's arc, unlike the others, is one of discovery. It must be sought. It will not come to him. It is a journey to understand Erath.

To succeed, Dunbar must study Erath and find ways to connect with her. He may not realize it, but he has encountered several already:

* Dreaming in Jorem Greentide's grotto
* Meditating at the Great Tree in Ter'rambla
* During the Taru'kai prayers for the fallen ylve at the phase spider encounter
* Communicating with Lokuma'kai when she made her plea in the tent

Each of these encounters where Dunbar has witnessed **network magic**, also known as **collective arcana**, are examples where Dunbar must learn to lean in and connect.

Depending on how much Dunbar seeks and learns to use this knowledge, he will be rewarded.

# Surveying the floodgate

When [the party exits the floodgate](/01-prep/sod-12-prep), they are surrounded by a band of monks, as evidenced by their dress and arms. A member of the band speaks to chastise the two young monks [Graegon](/02-players/graegon) recognizes from the night before. 

Dunbar notices a few things:

* The group that has greeted you outside the Ethewa'dan floodgate visibly numbers about 15.
* You sense there are more nearby but aren't sure how many.
* The speaker, who initially appeared to be an elf is actually a very tall goblyn.
* He does not see to be trying to intimidate Graegon but, rather, warn him.
* The air outside in the dim pre-dawn light is cool and even a bit moist.
* The mountains to the northwest rise up before you, seeming closer than ever before, their jagged peaks disappearing into storm clouds that glimmer with the pale light of a setting moon.
* You realize those mountains must be home to the White Sun Oruks you've heard of.
* The air of expectancy is palpable to Dunbar, as if the land knows that Spring itself is coming to visit, an entire season at once. The pulse of natural magic is almost overwhelming.
* In the plains that stretch from the floodgate to the foot of the mountains, you see a winding empty riverbed. The twinkling of torchlight is visible on the nearest bank, where a number of strange, stilted structures stand. The scent of boat timber drifts faintly but unmistakably to you. 
* All of these impressions arrive to you in relative harmony, but there is another strain in the air as well.
* Here, in the air around Ethewa'dan, you sense fragments of malevolence that you cannot decipher. Something dark has indeed happened near Ethewa'dan tonight.

# Studying the sky

Feeling the malevolence in the air, Dunbar's eye sweep the sky
do any of the constellations that he saw in his Augury seem to shine brighter?

## Dunbar's second augury

The dim pre-dawn light makes reading this alien sky difficult, and for a moment frustration makes you curse yourself for not paying closer attention earlier. 

For a moment your mind wanders as you search the sky. Why have I not seen this before?
 
And though this sky is indeed foreign to you, something breaks through to your mind, the way a clear breeze pushes out the cloying smoke of a smoldering fire.
 
You are calm and you can see. 
 
And though they occupy strange positions and appear among stars you don't remember from your Augury at Greentide's, a trio of familiar constellations snaps into focus, becoming obvious all at once:

First, are the twin horns of Judgement.

Second, is the skeletal gallows of the Hanged One.

And the third, of course. . . is the Stranger.

## A reward for his study

Dunbar's first reward will augment his [Circle of the Stars](https://www.dndbeyond.com/search?q=circle+of+stars) features with **Stellar Divination**:

* Once per long rest, you can study the constellations of the night sky and cast [Divination](https://www.dndbeyond.com/search?q=divination).
* When you do, instead of asking questions of a specific god or god's servants, you seek the answer in the stars.
* The answer is truthful, though it may be cryptic or in the form of a puzzle/riddle, and it comes to you in terms of the constellations in the sky.
* Can only be cast when stars of the night sky are visible.

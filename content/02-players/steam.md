Steam loses the magical blade given to him by Shayel, the Autarch's Daughter. The blade snaps during battle and sinks to the depths of the Ean'del cistern.

# Thus drowns the Sword of Vengeance 

## How it happened

* Fighting the [aboleth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/aboleth) at Ean'del Cistern — after Wangari's Divine Smite drives the aboleth (250 hp) below, Steam brings The Sword of Vengeance to bare on the fleeing creature.
* Steam's blow lands on top of the aboleth's skull, just behind its most distal pair of eyes, smashing into a part of its body that houses its arcane center, the organ that attunes it to the magic of Ean'del. It is a region protected with a thick dense sheath of bone infused with the magic it guards.
* As Steam's killing blow slams into the aboleth's skull, the vengeful magic of the blade collides right into the water magic of the creature — and the bone not only glances the blow but shatters the blade in a hideous metallic ring that echoes throughout the cavern.
* The business end of the Sword of Vengeance, the magical blade given to Steam by Shayel, The Autarch's Daughter Themselves, snaps near its base and tumbles into the cistern.
* The magical blade drops rapidly, glowing pale blue as it sinks.
* Graegon Fletcher, while grappling the aboleth underwater, sees the blade and reaches for it as it falls past. . . but misses.
* The blade slips past the monk and into the endless depths of Ean'del, its blue light dropping quickly out of view.

## What does it mean?

# Petro Arnogast: Lost or found?

After [Taria's disappearance](/01-prep/sod-12-prep-scrying-split-blood#murderinethewa'dan) (and assassination), Petro has remained behind, or at least his wagon has. In fact, his wagon appears to have been completely ransacked and abandoned. What happened here?

## Toss the cobbler

The tinker's wagon is in disarray because Petro did so before he left. What better way to secure something than make it appear like it has no value?

Detect the ruse with Investigation (DC 20) or via magical tinkering (or some other means that requires Steam).

Check out the tinker's wagon puzzle — perhaps Arnogast has also fled but left his wagon behind with a message for Steam.

## What's in the box?

Petro left a box behind for Steam, hidden casually on the floor under a chair, masked by some draped fabric, a bucket of tools, and a stack of old books.

The box is made of a phenomenally strong dark wood with simple but expertly-set bands of inlaid metal that all culminate in a ring that stands vertically on top of the box. A rolled-up scroll of what appears to be raw paper is nestled in the ring like a napkin:

>"Before you can learn about your armor, you must understand your tools and skills. Bring these three keys into harmony. Only then will they reveal their secret."  *—Petro Arnogast*
>

To solve this riddle, Steam must use his Magical Tinkering feature to set each of the three keys ringing at a different pitch so that together they play a chord.

Within the box are fragments of a ***Chem Maintenance Manual***, written in a strange, glyph-based language. (Or perhaps the box contains a map that leads to where the fragments are stored, along with Petro's strange theories about the origins of the Gods and Banes.)

title: Skol Frostbeard
---

Skol Frostbeard is infected with the Shadow that Jorem Greentide introduced to him in the grotto on the Mor'dani Wastes. Skol is living on borrowed time—yet the Shadow has also given him great powers and arcane insight (divination wizardry).

Part of what is dramatic about this character arc is that the very thing that is killing Skol is also responsible for his great power. What will happen if he loses that?

# Seduction

* While dashing through the Ethewa camp after Dunbar, chasing after someone the druid is convinced must be their missing comrade Aritrix Tosscobble, Skol Frostbeard's thoughts are struck like a bolt with a psychic message from his familiar, Weak hawk, who is circling  above the camp: "Look! There!"
* Skol follows the impressions imparted by the magical bird and turns his attention to a small cluster of tents just ahead on the right, at the edge of the camp. Dunbar is already there, darting into a crease between two tents after the fleeing rogue. The pair pass out of view and the alley seems empty again. 
* But then he sees it.
* As though stepping out of a long shadow and into existence, a tall lanky elven figure emerges. 
* At first the figure is barely more than a silhouette—and so Skol might wonder whether this apparition were simply an illusion, something not quite real. But that impression is rudely dispelled when the figure slowly cranks its head around to look straight at Skol. And grins. Wry. Darkly humorous. Familiar. 
* Unbidden, flashes of the dark things that attacked Jorem Greentide when the Yankers first fled the Mor'dani, visions of the thing that infected Dhenn in the pit inside Ter'rambla, the dark dreams that night in Greentide's grotto. And the strange arcane talents that snuck up on Skol in the days that followed. 
* All of these things surge forward at once, tighten in sickening recognition of the power behind that grin.
* And without realizing it, Skol draws closer, fascinated by the lanky figure from the shadows.
* Having turned full circle to face Skol, the figure steps to the edge of a tent shadow Skol approaches:
    > "Do you ever wonder why that kid fell so ill, aye while even the mighty Jorem giant succumbed, yet you have. . . thrived?" 
    >
    >The voice makes a faint whistle as it emphasizes that last word with a mouth of what sounds like broken teeth. _Thrived_. The end of a ragged cigarette glows, illuminating just the rawest outline of the gray speaker's long jaw.
    >
    > "Your heart claims to be ambitious, Skol. You have arrived here and discovered power. And yet, what have you spent it on but aimless wandering. Is this all you will you do with it? What is it that you want?"
    >
    > "Too late. The people I work for know you now. And once they know you, they don't forget you. You're in, Skol. Like it or not. Only question now, whose side you on?"

# Epiphany at Droughtbreak

* When the Drought Bane lifts, the shadow in Skol recoils violently.
* Immediately upon Droughtbreak, Skol must make a CON save (DC 20). If he fails, Skol takes 3d10 radiant damage and falls unconscious for d6 hours. On a success he takes half damage and maintains consciousness, though he is afflicted with great pain (pass a CON save, DC 10, or cry out. **Do this in whispers** so that the rest of the party does not get curious about Skol.
* What if Skol's shadow became like a disease that would kill him every 90 days. Each time the team can resurrect him, but they cannot cure the disease. And so the cycle goes on.
* The disease that is growing in him, threatening to consume him, can only be cured by some specific epic event:
    * The Shadow is defeated
    * He returns to Faerun
    * Giving it to someone else from Faerun
    * Being healed by Jorem Greentide
    * Leaving Erath
    * Purifying himself in some ritual
    * Go to the world of the gods (which of course requires the Blade of Vengeance)
* Skol also discovers a way in which his disease is a boon — by studying how the shadow within him reacts, Skol can make a lot of inferences about Shadow, perhaps even how to defeat it!

# Action at a distance

When Gideon met with Skol outside the Great Hall at Ethewa'dan, the grey ylve planted an arcane tracking device on the fiercely intelligent but only moderately perceptive dwarf.

Oisin will discover this device:

> ### Bugging out
>
> Oisin will discover the bug the next time she investigates (DC20) the party or Skol in particular, or when she takes inventory of their gear.

# Skol's Shadow Strikes

Gideon gives the clippings of hair and nail (for which he traded Skol the [Scroll of Dispel Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic)) to shadowir who use it to shapeshift into or create a simulacrum of Skol. The Skol doppelganger then commits the assassination. 

Initially, the Ethewa do not have a specific suspect. Eventually they will light on Skol, thanks to an eyewitness who placed a dwarf leaving the Arcanist's lab or near the site where the body was found. The eyewitness? [Ido Wenda](/03-people/ido-wenda).

# Shadow recognizes shadow

Skol's shadow tries to compel him through the portal, hoping to spread itself and devour Faerun. When Kobra arrives, Skol is the only one who sees the shadow clinging to her, and he recognizes it. Regardless, Skol gains 1d4+3 temporary hit points, as surge of shadow leaps from Kobra to Skol. This continues each turn until Kobra is defeated. From this point forward, Skol is also resistant to necrotic damage.

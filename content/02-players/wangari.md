Wangari takes the [Oath of the Watchers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin#OathoftheWatchers) after the Sisters of Undine challenge her to renounce her Oath of Vengeance and defend Erath.

# A new purpose

Wangari's Oath of the Watchers requires these commitments:

1. **Be vigilant.** The threats you face are cunning, powerful, and subversive. Be ever alert for their corruption.
1. **Be constant.** Do not accept gifts or favors from the Shadowir or those who truck with them. Stay true to the Sisters, your comrades, and your duty.
1. **Be discipline.** You are a shield against the endless terrors that lie beyond the stars. Your blade must be forever sharp and your mind keen to survive what lies beyond.

Wangari gains these additional features:
* Wangari's [Divine Sense](https://www.dndbeyond.com/search?q=divine+sense) now includes _Sisters of the Undine_.
* When Wangari next uses an Oath of Watchers feature, she will be contacted by the Sisters. The voice that comes to her is the collective, which functions as its own independent consciousness (think "Chinese brain" experiment). 
* The collective transforms or at least augments her [Ring of Mind Shielding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ring-of-mind-shielding). Once per long rest she can attempt to communicate with the Sisters of the Undine.

# Enhanced Divine Sense

Once per day, Wangari can use her [Divine Sense](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin#ClassFeatures) to **Commune with the Undine**:

> ### Commune with the Undine
>
>You call on the power of your Oath and your favor with the Sisters of the Undine to put you in contact with the collective of sentient cephalopods. Make a WIS (DC 16) check. If you pass, you make contact with the spiritual network that the Sisters of the Undine use to think and act as a super-organism.
>
>You ask the collective a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.
>
> The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
>
> The focus and spiritual energy spent while in commune with the Undine exhausts you. If you commune two or more days in a row, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.

When Wangari fails her Wisdom check, she can use a future action to spend another use of Divine Sense and try again.

Once Wangari succeeds, she cannot use this feature again until the following dawn.

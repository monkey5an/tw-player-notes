# The death of Tosscobble

What happened to Aritrix Tosscobble when she wandered off from the party on the way back from Ter'rambla to Ethewa'dan:

Feeling a strong need to be alone and an irresistible urge to explore this strange land in which she finds herself, Aritrix breaks off from the party—time, she muses, for a walkabout.

So Aritrix lights out eastward away from the Mor'dani, across the grasslands and into the foothills that line the empty river valleys of Ethewa.

She travels contentedly and uneventfully for two days and then starts back to join the party.

But on the way, just as she picks up the trail of the party, Aritrix discovers that someone else is trailing the party as well. So, she decides to hold off on rejoining the party and starts following the follower. 

And although she tracks her quarry well, doing so was no small feat. Each day the tracks are different.

Then, one night she sneaks up close on a short humanoid figure in the shadows and watches it. . . change.

Aritrix realizes this thing tracking the party is a shapeshifter.

In that moment of shock, perhaps Aritrix accidentally let out a sound. Whatever it was, the shapeshifter discovers Aritrix and attacks her. 

Aritrix fights as she grew up , a swashbuckler. But despite a valiant effort, Aritrix is overmatched, and her wounds are grievous—will they prove fatal, she wonders? Is this how my life will end—alone in a strange world, killed by a creature who's true face I've never seen?

Just then a blast comes from the side, striking the shapeshifter, who flees just as Aritrix loses consciousness.

The last image she has is of the old Crone, who Aritrix had snubbed on the road at the start of her adventure in Faerun.

She awakes (resurrected?) near a campfire, alone and wrapped in a blanket that is not hers.

A note by the fire reads: 

> "For you who are no longer Tosscobble. You are now Oisin, and you bear this mark, a gift from me."
>
> "Oh. Also, this is for you."

On your arm is a tattoo of the Hierophant's mark. Folded up by your side is a [Trickster's Doublet](../05-items/tricksters-doublet)


# The return of the Crone

 After the party battles the dragon Kobra's ghost in the Sanctuary, the Crone appears to Oisin. It is the third time they have met—first on the road to Phandelver, then on the return to Ethewa'dan, and now here.

## Struck by lightning

When Oisin is struck by Kobra's breath weapon, the following chain of events is set into motion.

> ### A shocking discovery
>
> The next time someone uses Medicine or Investigation to assess Oisin, they may discover (DC 15) that Oisin has been resurrected, likely in the last fortnight.

### Phase 0: The borders grow thin

When the battle with Kobra'kai begins and Graegon and party phases in and out, Oisin starts to feel a cold throbbing pain in her right wrist. If Oisin looks at it, her tattoo—the Mark of the Hierophant—burns pale blue with power.

She gets the feeling that the borders between worlds are thin both at this time and in this place, but also others not far away.

Oisin has disadvantage on her next attack.

### Phase 1: Hearing voices

When Oisin is hit by Kobra's breath weapon, her synapses fry and make a strange circuit. For the rest of this turn, the Crone speaks to Oisin in snippets, communicating the following:

* The Crone has come to Oisin. 
* She reminds Oisin that this is the third time they have met, so perhaps this one will be the charm.

Oisin is immune to lightning until the end of her turn.

### Phase 2: Dancing runes

The [Trickster's Doublet](../05-items/tricksters-doublet) comes alive in a way that hasn't yet been witnessed. The embroidered runes take on the color of Kobra's lightning and begin shifting and coursing, not unlike the patterns on Loxien'kai but more clearly artifactual than organic.

The crone points to Kobra and explains that she is both Kobra and not Kobra. She is an avatar now. More than a ghost, less than a god. She is here for a reason. She is here for a test.

### Phase 3: To leave or not to leave

When Kobra is defeated, she uses her remaining energy to create an image of a portal, using an ephemeral artifact not unlike the Shadiphid. It is not quite a portal, but the Crone shows Oisin how to make it real. And then she must open it and walk through or they must close it and return.

## The Portal Witch

Oisin holds open the portal, which starts to oscillate:
* If she focuses on the oscillation (Aracana), she can hone in on the oscillations the way a spider senses vibrations in its web — something is coming!
* This episode triggers the Crone, who helps tease the truth from Oisin's intuition—what are these runes, whose meaning she feels lies just on the edge of comprehension. One image in particular that fills her mind — the sign of the Hierophant — she sees its signature clearly in the runes that dance everywhere. The Hierophant, Builder of Bridges Between Worlds. 
* She feels the hand of the Old Crone on her shoulder:
> "You can see, Oisin. Good. Now I will tell you the truth. I am not a god nor am I a mere mortal. I am a trickster, a Portal Witch. I do not build the bridges, that is the Hierophant's work, but we find them. And just as often, we hide them from others. We owe allegiance to none but ourselves. We mind the paths between worlds and hide knowledge of them so that none can control them. In this one way we have more power than god or spirit. Now that I have given you the gift, you are on that path as well, should you choose to follow."  *—The Old Crone*
* Oisin has the ability to attune to these portals, which cut across universes rather than planes. The tricksters (also known as Portal Thieves) can use them to travel in time by cutting out of a world at one point in time and then re-enter from another portal:
> "Yet while you have the power to attune and manipulate the gates to these bridges, you cannot create one, you can only influence one that is already open." (At least so far, a voice deep within you whispers)
* Oisin must use her concentration to hold the portal open. Each time she drops concentration, the portal energy fades a bit more.
* ***Failure condition:*** If Oisin loses concentration three times, **the portal closes**. When the portal closes, the shadow has won, since it is now in Erath. Kobra escapes, and the Shadowir gain in strength. 
* ***Victory condition:*** If Oisin manages to maintain concentration until Kobra'kai is defeated and driven back through the portal, then the Shadowir have lost a significant battle and slink back into retreat.
* Anyone who does a Medicine (WIS DC 15) check discovers that Oisin appears to be healthy but also that she has been [resurrected recently](/02-players/oisin#struckbylightning)).

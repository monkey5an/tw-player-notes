This is a collection of house rules so that everyone is clear on what happens when.

# Critical hits & fumbles

When the result of a d20 attack roll is a 20 on the die, the attack automatically hits, regardless of the target's AC, and the attacker scores a **critical hit**. Critical hits represent punishing blows that not only do additional damage but can also impose a tactical penalty on the defender. 

When the result of a d20 attack roll is a 1 on the die, the attack automatically misses and the attacker suffers a **critical fumble**. Critical fumbles represent catastrophic misses that can impose a tactical penalty on the attacker.

## Critical hits

When an attacker scores a critical hit, the player rolls regular damage for the attack and adds critical damage. The player then has the opportunity to punish the defender and achieve a tactical advantage.

**Roll regular damage.** Roll all of the attack's damage dice and add them together. Then add any relevant damage modifiers.

**Add critical damage.** Roll the damage dice again and add them to the total damage.

**Punish the defender.** Before making a d20 attack roll, a player may state their character's intention. For example, a fighter could announce that they are trying to "slash the roper's tentacle so they can't attack with it." When a character scores a punishing crit, that intention succeeds. To determine the outcome, follow these steps:
* *Determine the degree of success.* Roll d100 to determine how well the intention succeeded, where 100 is the most successful. 
* *Apply a tactical penalty.* The GM interprets the degree of success and applies the appropriate tactical penalty to the defender. For example, suppose the attack was intended to injure a limb so that the target cannot attack with it, and the result of the player's success roll is a 1. The GM interprets the attack as minimally successful and so only grants disadvantage on the target's next attack. However, if the player rolls a 100, the GM might determine that the tentacle was completely amputated, not only permanently preventing the target from attacking with that limb but potentially causing additional damage due to blood loss. 

## Critical fumbles

**Punish the attacker.** When a character scores a critical fumble, any intention the player declared for their attack fails. To determine the consequence of their failure, follow these steps:
* *Determine the degree of failure.* Roll d100 to determine how badly the attacker's intention failed, where 100 is the most successful. 
* *Apply a tactical penalty.* The GM interprets the degree of failure and applies the appropriate tactical penalty to the defender. For example, suppose the attack was intended to injure a limb so that the target cannot attack with it and the result of the player's failure roll is a 1. The GM interprets the failure as minimal and so may rule the character overswings and stumbles, with no effect. However, if the player rolls a 100, the GM may determine that the errant blow exposes a weakness in the character's magic scimitar, forcing the player to succeed at a suitably challenging saving throw or watch the blade snap off and fall into a bottomless lake.

## Tactical penalties

When determining tactical penalties, the GM can choose whatever penalty they see fit. In general, follow these guidelines:
* *Tie the penalty directly to the character's specific intention for the attack.*
* *Let the players provide feedback on penalties before you impose them*â€”especially when a penalty targets a player. Even better, encourage the players to propose their own penalties.
* *Catastrophic penalties should always include a saving throw.* For example, if a player critically fumbles and rolls a 100 for the degree of failure, don't just snap their favorite magic weapon in two. Instead, propose a suitably challenging saving throw for the item.

**Minor vs. major penalties.** Simplicity is fun. To keep it simple, think of two severities for penalties. Minor penalties should be relatively mild and short-lived. Imposing disadvantage on the next attack this turn is a minor penalty. Imposing disadvantage for the rest of the battle is major. In the same vein, 1d4 extra damage is minor. Rolling another round of damage dice is major.

**Conditional vs. automatic penalties.** Penalties can be automatic, taking effect immediately, or the GM can them conditional. A conditional penalty is applied only if some additional circumstance is met. For example, the penalty for a creature hit in the legs might be that the creature's movement speed is reduced by 10 feet *but only if* the next attack against that creature is a hit. Conditional penalties are a lot of fun because they can involve other players, encouraging team play and the feeling they are completing "combos."

**Catastrophic penalties.**

|  | Conditional | Immediate |
---------|----------|--|
| **Minor**| 0-25 | 51-75 |
| **Major** | 26-50 | 74-99 |
| **Catastrophic** | -- | 100 |

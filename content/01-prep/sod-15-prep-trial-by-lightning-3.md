metaTitle: "prep"
metaDescription: "Notes for Session 15"
---

Having just defeated the Specter of Kobra, the Fellowship find themselves alone in some kind of between place, a lacuna in the space-time-magic around Erath. Where Kobra once stood, there is now an open portal, similar to the one that brought the party here, except that rather than the theatrics of a spider web, this portal is wrought from pure energy, condensed into a network of ropy bluish plasma, from which there is a constant discharge of ionizing energy arcing to the walls around it. Looking into the portal is like gazing at a shimmer in reality, buzzing with streams of runes that seem engraved into the fabric of everything, etched on every molecule and atom that passes near it. 

Oisin has identified this portal as a bridge to the world of Faerun, in a feat that is new to her but has brewing ever since the Crone saved her from a shapeshifter who had been tracking the party back from Ter'rambla. Oisin also believes the party has a choice: — Oisin can hold the portal open and let the part across, or she can close it, causing the pocket in which they are phased to collapse, sending them back to the Kobra'kai sanctuary.

While the party contemplate the question, a few things happen to color their decision:
* Wangari reaches out to the Sisters of the Undine, who ask her to stand as the Guardian of the Undine. If she accepts, they reveal quite a lot.
* Skol's shadow tries to compel him through the portal, hoping to spread itself and devour Faerun.

Just as things are at a head or an impasse, or a dramatic peak, A small but beatific blue dragonborn female walks through the portal. She is the evolutionary culmination of a dragonborn and yet she is the first, she is Kobra herself and she has come from Faerun's deep past. When she sees Graegon she smiles at the fulfillment of her promise. So she adds more to the mix by explaining the POV of the gods who must decide whether the Fellowship is worthy of influencing the fate of Erath or whether the gods should annihilate them here and now.

Thus begins Kobra Redux — the Trial of the Strangers:

> "Are you worthy of shaping the fate of Erath? Or should the gods, me among them, Ethewa'kai — visiting you here in the avatar of Kobra — should we not annihilate you here and now?" *—Kobra'kai*

# Last session

# Set the stage

## What your characters know by now

Remind the part of the following, which their characters certainly understand at this point:

* The Fellowship have rapidly adjusted to Erath. In only three weeks, each of the party have discovered and developed talents well beyond anything they had accomplished in their entire lives prior to coming here. This recognition may be exhilarating or frightening, natural or unnatural depending on the character's perspective. 
* In the same period, some Shadow force has also arrived on Erath and so far has also grown rapidly. By contrast, the Banes have been around for awhile, though you have learned little about these catastrophic events or how frequently they occur.
* Regardless, the banes are too powerful and too erratic to be the product of natural forces alone. Therefore there must be a magical component to them.
* Much of the magical fabric of Erath originates from, works through, and is amplified by complex networks, from the Great Trees and the river-dwelling Sisters of the Undine to the Ethewa themselves, who weave their magic together to help sustain the land during the Banes. And then of course there are the portals themselves, bridges that connect worlds together.
* It is not hard to see how vulnerable Erath would be if the health of these networks were somehow compromised, the impact that could have.

# Scenes

* [**Portal Witch.**](/02-players/oisin#theportalwitch) Oisin struggles to hold the portal open — if the portal closes, the phase bubble will collapse and the party will return to the Kobra'kai sanctuary. The longer she holds the portal open, the more likely Kobra will arrive, and when she does she will be corrupted with Shadow from the journey. As the battle begins, Oisin starts to realize that if the portal closes while Kobra is here, the Shadow-driven avatar will return to Erath with them as well. This means that the gods are vulnerable to Shadow as well. 
* [**Kobra'kai emerges**](/03-people/kobra-kai/kobra#emergent) — An avatar fragment embodied in a beatific blue dragonborn emerges from the portal but something is off. . . as she comes through the portal shadow follows her, she has been corrupted.
* [**Shadow recognizes shadow.**](/02-players/skol#shadowrecognizesshadow) — Skol's shadow tries to compel him through the portal, hoping to spread itself and devour Faerun.
* [**Commune with the Undine.**](/02-players/wangari#enhanceddivinesense) — Wangari uses her Enhanced Divine Sense reach out to the Sisters of the Undine, who ask her to stand as the Guardian of the Undine. If she accepts, they reveal quite a lot, including an augury of the party.
* [**Kobra'kai demands fealty and trial**](/03-people/kobra-kai/kobra#toughlove) — Kobra takes a dark turn as the Shadow surges within her. More and more she rants in Celestial, fixated on Graegon, she become increasingly focused on him, provided he manages to keep her attention with damage and taunts.

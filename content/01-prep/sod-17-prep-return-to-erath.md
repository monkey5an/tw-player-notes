# Strong start

* On the Shadow side's turn, the Gloomwood tree at the portal summons a pair of [Derro Savants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/derro-savant), one of whom immediately launches a [Lightning Bolt](https://dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt) across the canyon at Oisin, passing not only through Wangari but also the polymorphed sheepâ€”the transmutation spell ends and Weeping Treant stands less than 30 feet from Oisin! A few moments pass and then two more trees are infected.

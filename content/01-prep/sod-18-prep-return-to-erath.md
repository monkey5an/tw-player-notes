Tease

# Characters

* **Dunbar Swiftide**
* **Wangari Shire**
* **Graegon Fletcher**
* **Skol Frostbeard**
* **Steam**
* **Oisin**

# Last time

* The Shadow started last session strong. Severely weakened, the Shadowood made a last desperate push to shut the portal, using its last Season of Malice to harvest two Shadow Savant spellcasters, one of whom launched a lightning bold from across the battlefield at Oisin, striking the polymorphed Weeping Treant, who as a sheep had been peacefully meandering (randomly) across the map. When struck, the treant snapped back into its natural form and immediately made for Oisin!
* Taking advantage of the momentum, the treants raced to Oisin and began to beat her down, forcing her to drop concentration.
* With no one to channel the resonant energies between worlds, without a portal witch, the passage between Faerun and Erith began to close.
* The Yankenblast crew rallied and set up a healer team around Oisin while the toughs duked it out with the Shadow, clearing out the side.
* With no creatures out and no infected trees, the Shadowood became vulnerable. It would only remain so until its next turn, when it could again infect trees.
* Wangari stepped up, pressure on, since the Shadowood's turn was next—and let loose the full measure of her eldritch energy. Each beam slammed the tree with such force and imparted such resonance that the tree disintegrated into a cloud of splinters.
* Team took a well-deserved rest:
    * Oisin—short rested so that she could maintain concentration.
    * All else long rested.
    * Everyone leveled to 9.  

# The way things are now

The party have been gone for about 7 days.

Though the shadow has subsided for now, and the creative magic of Erith invigorates Ethewa, this is still a time of great danger.   Ethewa has become a place of great volatility. As the ecology and economies and magic of Erith rush to keep pace with the radical transformation of the land, the greatest threats now come from within:
* The forests, from the mountains to the edge of Ethewa'dan to the West and to the Veiled Gap in the East, have returned in a matter of days.
* The end of the drought has sent a tide of ambitious traders and devout pilgrims up from the south and across the grasslands to the east. Many are headed to Kima, for the hearth forge and the ritual springs.
* They now shelter brigands and thieves, eager to take advantage of the crisis in Ethewa'dan.
* The forests are becoming defensive, fighting back.

# Strong start

* The party must choose whether to go back to Erith or journey forth into the portal. 
* All that remains of the tree is a pale length of heartwood protruding from its blackened stump, like an offering. Is it of surrender or defiance?
* [Should they stay or should they go?](/01-prep/sod-18-prep-return-to-erath#shouldwestayorshouldwego?)

# Scenes

## Should we stay or should we go?

## Return to Sanctuary

## Dark news gleefully given

* Ethewa'dan remains in crisis.
    * Dendra returns. Taria's death is known. She seems to relish telling Dareel that Lloth'Ivan has declared her death an assassination and has charged The Strangers:
    * Lloth'Ivan claims to have evidence the Strangers assassinated her. 
    * In particular, they suspect Skol:
        * Around the time of the murder, guards at the Great Hall reported talking to the Strangers but did not see Skol.
        * Also, there are reports of a dwarven wizard using enchantment magic on folks at the Calling of the Clans to steal food and drink. 
        * There were also reports of a strange dire wolf with the dwarf.
        * There was evidence of transmutation magic when the Ido Wenda examined the scene.
        * One of the junior arcanists confirmed that she saw transmutation magic when Skol let her look through his spellbook.

## Someone's been eating my porridge

Oisin will discover that someone has been going through their things. This 'someone' is Dendra. The question is whether Oisin will realize:
* Skol's alchemical goods have been rummaged through.
* Jindri's journal notes are in a different spot.
* One of Fletch's glassblower's tools is missing.
* The map they copied from the Engineers is in a different bag than it was.

## Action at a distance

When Gideon met with Skol outside the Great Hall at Ethewa'dan, the grey ylve planted an arcane tracking device on the fiercely intelligent but only moderately perceptive dwarf.

Oisin will discover this device:

> ### Bugging out
>
> Oisin will discover the bug the next time she investigates (DC20) the party or Skol in particular, or when she takes inventory of their gear.

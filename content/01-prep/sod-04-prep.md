# The Party

* **Wangari Shire.** (Cori) Half-elf paladin. Earnest and true. Discovers a warlock talent on Erath. But who will her patron turn out to be? What service will it require? In a dream state, brought on by the heady magic of forest druid, Wangari encountered what she took to be a warrior queen ancestor or spirit and swore a paladin Oath of Vengeance.
* **Dunbar Swiftide.** (Dennen). Human Ranger/Druid. A young man in search of his lost sister, joins the sea as a lookout and bowman. Discovers a druidic talent on Erath. Why does he have this strange connection to the land? Will he ever see his sister again? Under the influence of similar forest magic Dunbar discovers a star map, which he now uses as his magical focus. He has one week to make (or have someone make) a proper physical copy or he will forget it. 
* **Graegon Fletcher.** (Keola). Blue dragonborn monk. Raised in a monastery. After the death of his master and guardian, Graegon was no longer safe. When ambushed by several of his brother monks, Graegon explodes with magic as unexplained as it is furious. Despondent, Graegon goes willingly to death row and instead of the gallows finds a portal to another world. Will he find a sense of belonging in his a new life, or will his past consume him?
* **Oisin, formerly Aritrix Tosscobble.** (Katy). Halfling rogue. Damaged goods with a cynical mind but a stout heart. Far too in the moment (and the shadows) to be much of a thinker. Tosscobble discovers religion of sorts on Erath. But whereas Wangari finds a patron, the young halfling must find strength in her own **faith**. But where will she place that most intimate of trusts? It starts with a tattoo on her arm.
* **Steam** (Dave) class. Character intro. An god-forged from a future civilization who has lost its memory and is met in the [tomb of the autarch's daughter](sod-2-tomb-of-the-autarchs-daughter.html). Could even be **Kyl**, Ethin Gannin's med bot, who is ultimately held for the murder of the Ethewa'dim rangeherd.
* **Skol Frostguard** (Marc) Dwarven cleric/wizard.

## Skol Frostbeard

### An ambitious beginning

* Distant relative of [Gundren Rockseeker](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gundren_Rockseeker), dwarven industrialist who rediscovered the Echo Wind Cave.
* Skol desperately wants to earn his family's respect by "making his fortune."
* Wrote to Gundren three years ago. Nothing for two years. Then it came, a vague invitation to join an opportunity in [Phandalin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Phandalin),  near Neverwinter. 
* But while Skol readied for his journey, rumors swept through the family—Gundren was lost or missing and feared dead. 
* And so with his dream in jeopardy, Skol worked his way to Neverwinter and began looking into Rockseeker's disappearance.
* Near Phandalin, by the ruins of an old manor near where Gundren was last seen, Skol met a strange pale boy who befriended the ambitious dwarf.
* The boy, who went by the name Marblemore, was preternaturally charming and wise. But he was equally callous and cunning for his age.
* The lanky boy bard and the stout dwarf made quite the pair, well noticed, often in the seedier affairs. And so it was that Skol became less of a cleric and more of a rogue.
* During their journey, Marblemore tells Skol that he knows who killed Gundren and that he saw them escape through some kind of spider portal.
* When Skol hears this, he decides that this is the route to his true fortune. And so he dedicates the next year to forcing Marblemore to help him find a way through that portal.
* After much searching and even more inns and ale, Marblemore eventually found the old goblin who'd given the party the Shadiphid (spider artifact) that activated the portal.
* Thus, **one full year after the party went through the portal**, Skol enters a similar portal from a dingy house boat in Neverwinter harbor and finds himself transported to Erath (the world where the campaign takes place) outside The Tomb of the Autarch's Daughter. 
* Skol arrives just as the party exit the tomb. But for the party **only an hour has passed** since they crossed through.

### A Night to Remember

* Skol's life changed irreversibly that night the party spent with Greentide. The forest druid, overcome with some necrotic shadow that had attacked him while they had fled the tomb, had come to Skol while he slept. Possessed in some way by that necrotic force, Greentide enchanted Skol and passed some of that corrupting shadow to Skol.
* It is not clear whether the quiet insistent voice that came to him in his head was part of the disease or whether the disease had merely freed a voice that had been waiting to speak long before Skol was even born. 
* What is clear is that Skol found his power that night, infused with disease but also drawing strength from the strange power of this new Land.
* And during that night, he was also infused with arcane knowledge. Thus Skol Frostbeard became a Shadowmage (Neutral Evil, Knowledge cleric/Divination wizard).

# Strong Start

The party meets Ido Wenda, an elve arcanist and Ethe-watchwright.

* Ido Wenda approaches the group, an [auroch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/aurochs) cow in tow. 
* "Well met strange . . . (scans the party, smiles ruefully) . . . Well. I guess I should hope friends, the way you announced yourselves. So boldly stomping across the 'Dani!" 
* She is out on a survey and is curious (and privately cautious) of the party. She asks them to walk with her and Onkima for a bit. She is on her way to Ter'rambla. 
* Wenda tells the party they can go northwest to find Ethewa'dan or head to Ter'rambla. If the party does not offend her, she will offer to lead them to Ter'rambla, from where they can rest and plan their next move.

# Scenes

* Right at dawn the party emerges from the jaws of the Mor'dani. There they encounter Ido Wenda, the Ethe'watchwright. Wenda is traveling to a nearby outpost of sorts (Ter'Rambla) and offers to lead the party there.
* Ido and the party encounter a **Kuhl** daemon stalking a herd of starving ungulates ranging too far north.
* The party travels with Wenda to her cabin.
* Wenda wants the part to continue with her to Ethewa'dan so that they can tell the Council what they have seen.
* Graegon's staff of warning alerts him (and Aritrix) to a creature approaching stealthily up on the hill above the Watchwright's cabin.

# Focus NPCs

## Ido Wenda

### About

**Ido Wenda, Ethe'Watchwright.** Wenda is burly old woman named Ido. she studies "magic," surveys the ward, and smokes too much. she is  friendly to those she knows,  gruff to those she doesn't. An honest woman and a good teacher. In her youth there was no one in the valleys who could best her on the river.

* If anyone in the party uses _Create or Destroy Water_, or any other spell that summons water, Ido will be gravely offended. Water magic draws on existing pools. It does not create it out of nothing. That is because it is not simply water. But that is another story. 
* So when the party uses water magic, they are drawing on clan reserves without permission. Because they are near Danosi land, Ido is even more deeply offended, since the party is her guest. She is responsible for their behavior.
* From this point forward, Wenda will show her gruff side, permanently alienated from the caster.

### Quotes & Stuff

* There are some whose loyalty to themselves is greater than their loyalty to Erath.
* **If asked about Shayel.** This world, Erath, has seen many ages, and she has buried all of them eventually. There are stories of course, that tell of places where the memory of ages past comes to life. Perhaps your Shayel was among them? Perhaps if you remembered more about her?
* **About the paradox of the Autarch's Tomb.** If what you say is true, about coming through a portal from another world, perhaps you arrived at another time as well . . . Ido laughs:
    > I mean dimensional magic is one thing, planar magic another. But what you describe—that is . . . trans-universal magic. Magic that works anywhere, completely independent of its environment. How astonishing. If true. hmm.
    >
    > And if one can do that . . . if another universe can even theoretically exist, then why not time travel as well! Nasal laugh.
    >
    > Or perhaps you are ghosts. Though you certainly look noting like anything that has died on this Erath.

### Encounters

* Ido shows Skol how to craft a spell book. But he requires ink from Agith Endl, and she does not give the good stuff up cheaply.

# Additional NPCs

**Agith Endl**—
**The Danosi.** Largely familial clan of humanoids, similar to human near relatives, Denisova hominins—squat, wide faces with large, almond shaped eyes. Short, typically less than 5' tall. The Danosi tend the Gend'awa tree at Ter'rambla.
* Theirs were also the number who shadowed the party and subsequently scattered. It is rare that they would come north at all, let alone this far. 
* They despise the Mor'dani, where they believe a malevolent god has come and even now builds itself a throne. It is a subject of slightly more than friendly tension between Ido and Gherin, the master spirit healer at Ter'rambla.

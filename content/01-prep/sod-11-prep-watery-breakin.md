Lokuma'kai, one of the [sentient cephalopods](/01-prep) of the Sisters of the Undine, has recruited the party to take the scrying water that **Taria Gannin** intended for **Jindri Massinna** and present it to Kuma's sister, **Loxien'kai**, so that she can read its portents.

The challenge is that Xien has been meditating for decades in the Ean'del, the extremely deep underground lake on top of which Ethewa'dan itself is built! The presence of a Sister in the Ean'del is a matter of great diplopmatic and spiritual import for Ethewa and Undine alike.

So for generations, Xien has dwelled within the Ean'del, respiring these holiest of waters, living in spirit and in connection with her siblings, praying for the Undine and to the waters of Erath herself.

To deliver the water to Loxien'kai, the party will have to mount an ambitious break-in caper.

# The Stakes

* If the Ethewa discover the Party in Ean'del, they will prosecute this intrusion and desecration of their holy site vigorously.
* Lokuma'kai wants to conceal her involvement completely. She will do all she can to maintain secrecy, but if the party are caught and her testimony is required, she will offer it.
* If the Ethewa learn that the Sisters of Undine had any involvement, a diplomatic crisis ensues that triggers a political schism among the Ethewa. Taria Gannin argues in support of their alliance with the Sisters; Lloth'Ivan argues betrayal.

# Locations

### Great Hall

### Stairwell

### Flood Plain

* The architects of Ethewa'dan built the flood plain to allow the water of Ean'del to overflow in the riverbed in case of surges, which happen regularly, particularly when the Drought bane breaks and the waters first return. 
* The room is is little more than a football field-sized cavern with a series of large flood vents in the floor and a very large stone dam door to the east. When this mammoth door is drawn, water can escape the flood plain.

### Chimney

* [Grick swarm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/grick)


### Cave of Mouths

* [Mumbling Mouther swarm](https://i.imgur.com/hn5aksn.jpeg)—Trigger on light and motion. Attack intruders to trap them and raise alarm. Summons the Water Elemental to protect the entrance to the cistern.
    After blasting the Grick swarm, the sound of their chitinous beaks and shrieking tongues dies away, until all that can be heard is a faint mumbling nonsense coming from the dimgly glowing hole where **Steam** tossed his illuminated gem.

### Cistern

* [**Darkmantle swarm**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/darkmantle)—Trigger on sound. Drop from ceilings.
* [**Quipper swarm**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/quipper)—Trigger on entry to water, particularly shallows. Attract Eel Hounds.
* [**Eel Hound pack**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/36/ad/db/36addba394fd8a4ea2882f0ff1213e61.jpg)—Trigger on small prey available, such as quippers and darkmantles. Attract aboleth hunters.
* [**Marine Basilisk pack**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fd/5f/d7/fd5fd75587b1848d83c5f681fdc33a7b.jpg)
* [**Aboleth**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/aboleth)—Drawn by larger prey, such as Eel Hounds and humanoids who have fallen overboard. When subdued, the aboleth is large enough to offer as food to summon Loxien'kai.
* [**Loxien'kai**]
    * Massive, when she finally rises, her immensity is obviously the first thing one notices, being a gargantuan creature larger than any they have seen before in any world.
    * But it is the delicacy of her form that captivates, her skin rippling with a riot of chromatophoric colors and patterns impossibly fine and intricate. 
    * An Arcana check (DC 18) reveals that these patterns are much more than they appear—they are organized, part of a system of symbols and runes more complex than anything imaginable and yet distinctly familiar. And they are evolving, perhaps independently of Xien.
    * It is as though she were singing the songs of a million worlds all at once in her skin. . . well actually not her, perhaps, but what then?
    * Her scrying:

        >The water return will bring life to Erath, that is certain. 
        > 
        > My sisters have told me that the Jorem has crossed the Mor'Dani and holds counsel with the Suko giants to the northwest, beyond the White Sun.
        >
        > The drought breaks even now, and 
        >
        > And with the waters the giants will lead the forests to emerge, and the rivers will charge their way to the sea once more.
        >
        > And yet, Kai will not come.
        >
        > And though the drought will die, the waters will rise and the Flood Banes will swell the seas, yet Kai will not come.
        > 
        > And while Erath flourishes, so as well the shadow grows and, like the rivers, swells even now beyond its borders, threatening to consume us all.
        >
        > Yet Kai will not come.
        >
        > Because Kai herself. . . has fled.
        >
        > And here is where I see what Taria Gannin, Rangeward of the Taru'kai and Jindri Grand Massinna of Ter'Rambla could not:
        >
        > It is _you_ that have brought the Shadow to this land!
        >
        > *—Loxien'kai*
    * Loxien'Kai makes an offer to the party but speaks to Wangari in particular.
        > ### A challenge for Wangari
        > I see the searing heart of vengeance in you, paladin. You suffer greatly for those you love yet would make war on one who created you.
        >
        > Meanwhile, the plague you have introduced to this world will consume it, causing far more suffering than yours. Thus should I take vengeance on you? If no, then perhaps it might have been the same for the one who planted that fire in you to begin with?
        >
        > So then what vengeance will you pursue here?
        >
        > Would you not then re-dedicate yourself to the protection of others rather than vengeance for the dead? 
        >
        >Take the Oath of the Watcher and pledge your sword to Erath, to the Sisters of the Undine, and in return we will grant you favor!
        >
        > Beneath the dead rivers of Kai my sisters begin to stir in their muddy lairs. For even now, the drought break has come and soon the rebirth from death begins again.
        >
        > And yet death comes for Ethewa not only from without but within, too. They do not know it yet, but the shadow is here, now, in Ethewa. It has already killed once. At it will again tonight. 
        >
        > *—Loxien'kai*

# Last session

After exiting Ean'del floodgate, the Kobra'kai monks ambush the party and make a deal with Graegon.

Speaking with Kobra'kai daiko Dareel, in draconic, Graegon learns that the monks are awestruck by him and believe fletch—the Stranger monk—is the subject of their prophecy, about the children of a blue dragon returning to Erath.

The Kobra'kai offer the party sanctuary and a chance to prove themselves—a trial by combat for Graegon Fletcher, blue dragonborn monk of St. Dionysus.

The trial begins, and Graegon makes his way through the staged battles, starting with the two initiates who discovered Fletch in a bar tent at the Calling of Clans.

During the trial several strange things happen:
* At another point, Oisin notices that Dendra (Iron Ibis), the goblyn monk who's very publicly not let the trickster rogue out of her sight since she saw her at Ean'del, slipped away from her quarry. And shortly returned.
* Meanwhile in the trial Graegon starts having flashbacks from his childhood
    * as a tortured orphan whose only comfort was an elderly monk
    * as a young initiate murdering his brother monks in a release of unknown violent energy
* Then, during his trial with Elbu Laughing Otter, Fletch uses his breath weapon—Elbu falls instantly and time stands still. Dareel steps forward. And the pair face off.
* The two fall into a rhythm together, and the trial moves away from violence and bravado into a conversation, a dance. 
* Quietly at first, water starts falling into the sanctuary, beads glowing with the warm light of dawn. Rain—the Drought has broken. 
* The Droughtbreak affects everyone differently:
    * Skol is hit with a burst pain as the Shadow within him recoils from the surge of Erath magic released when the bane breaks.
    * Dunbar is almost overwhelmed with Erath magic and comes to a place of peace and clarity—will he use it to gain insight and understanding, or will he continue to focus on himself?
    * Oisin senses the presence of the Old Crone and the sign of the hierophant burns in her arm.
* Shortly thereafter, a huge BOOM is heard from with the wastes to the southwest, a sound the party has heard once before, when heralded their exit from the Autarch's Tomb in Cairn'del.
* The boom shakes the party and has an unexpected effect on Graegon—he is able to phase in and out of materiality, similar to the chronoblooms in the Autarch's Tomb (as well as the half-phased ylve the party found on the way back from Ter'rambla).
* Graegon and Dareel spar for what seems like hours, using his inspired ability fluently but unconsciously, until the party, perhaps in sympathy some kind of magical connection start phasing with him.
* They leave the kobra'kai behind and the reality of Erath grows thin. 
* And a great blue dragon resurrects itself before there eyes. She seems to recognize Graegon as her kin, but requires that he prove himself to her.
* And so combat with the ghost of Kobra, the Dragon Who Fled, begins.   

# The Bane lifts

* Dunbar senses it.
* Skol recoils from it.
* BOOM — from out in the Mor'dani Wastes
    * Thereafter, Graegon can use a bonus action to phase out of time
    * The phasing moves him back and forth between the Kobra'kai and Kobra's ghost—when he is not with the party and Kobra, Graegon is back fighting Dareel, and he must accept a blow from his future brother to return. 
    * In fact, while he is in phase with Dareel, he can ask questions of lore that could help him tactically with the fight.

# The crone returns

* [Oisin](/02-players/oisin) senses the old crone
* Her tattoo arm hurts
* The crone has a part of what comes next — the coming of the ghost of Kobra.
* Kobra returns and gives a speech to Graegon. It is a speech of love and hope, but it also demands trial by combat. Kobra challenges Graegon alone to see what his companions will do (it is a test).

# Kobra rises

Kobra is the ghost of a 16th level young [adult blue dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-blue-dragon).

* Armor class AC = 18
* To hit bonus = +8
* Breath weapon:
    * DEX 17
    * 6d10 lightning
* Only 2 Legendary Actions
* The party's Hero's Feast from Loxien'kai does not prevent frightening from Kobra, but it does mitigate it after one turn—"The echo of Loxien'kai steels your courage as the Comfort of Undine washes over you."
* Perhaps Kobra cannot be defeated while Graegon is out of phase with her.
* Dareel senses what is going on, and he may place the sash of his monk skirt on Graegon
    * This could give Graegon an ability from Way of the Cobalt Hand, such as Extract Aspects
    * This could grant some other ability.

> ### Statuses to remember
>
>Remind Skol that his radiant damage does not heal, though everything else did.
>
>Graegon is currently out of phase (relative to the party).
>
>Everyone but Steam and Oisin have saved against Kobra's Fearful Presence.

## A new trial begins

* The party will lkely lose to Kobra so feel free to really test them.
* Hiding behind pillars protects from breath weapon.

## The judging

* Kobra judges the party based on how they fight for each other:
    * If they lose, wake up in Dareel's care some days later.
    * If they defeat Kobra, give them a shadiphid. Let them return home if they want—maybe even end the campaign. . . then pull them back to Erath.

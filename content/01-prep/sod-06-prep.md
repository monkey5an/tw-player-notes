# Return to Ethewa'dan

## Strong Start

The party is summoned to Account by the Ethewa'dan Council of Kai. Meanwhile, preparations for a ritual.

## Scenes

* ** Meeting Jindri.** Dunbar spills into the air pocket at the base of the stairs down in Ter'rambla. She lies slumped on floor against the north wall of the hallway. Will the party have the smarts to take her corpse back to Ethewa'dan so that she can be resurrected.


## NPCs

### Key callouts

* **Ido Wenda**, female Ylve, Arcanist, member of council by virtue of being **Watchwright**.

* **Lloth'Ivan**, male Ylve, Herdsward, **First Heart of Shaya'dim (Assassins)**. Literally "Gift from the Gods." Their fellow clanspeople regard them coolly but with respect. They have not been called to action in centuries, but they are always vigilant. The Assassins are trained to discover ways their target is stalked by Death and then tease those threads into being.

* **Ged Straw**, male Ylve, **Chief Agriculturist**. Corpulent but incredibly strong for his age. Very intelligent but quiet, always listening. He cannot see with his eyes but has some magic/tech that grants him **Blindsight**. He is in tune with deep time.

* **Agith Endl**, female, Ylve, **Head Arcanist**.

* **The Danosi.** Largely familial clan of humanoids, similar to human near relatives, **Denisova hominins**â€”squat, wide faces with large, almond shaped eyes. Short, typically less than 5' tall. The Danosi tend the Gend'awa tree at Ter'rambla. 

    Theirs were also the number who shadowed the party and subsequently scattered. It is rare that they would come north at all, let alone this far. 
    
    They despise the Mor'dani, where they believe a malevolent god has come and even now builds itself a throne. It is a subject of slightly more than friendly tension between Ido and Gherin, the master spirit healer at Ter'rambla.

### From last time

* Dorro. Goblyn female Taru'kai.
* Tanlin. Ylven male Artisan. Gave cartographic paper and ink to Dunbar. Told Steam about Kyl.

* Kales. Ylven female Arcanist. Wants Skol's spellbook.

# What's been going on

* A scar has erupted out of the Mordani, a terrible dark river shrouded in a forest of gloom. Running ruler straight from the base of the Mordani toward Ethewa'dan. This is the Gloomvale, the shadow garden that creeps forth from the Pale Tree/White Needle1.
* The Gloomvale would have grown further, making its assault on Ethewa and beyond, but the party's victory over the shadow wood previously appears to have arrested it.
* The party has no money and no supplies. Meanwhile, they may also need to get better gear so that they can meet the coming challenges.
* The party wants to clear their name with the Ethewa.
* The party has discovered a tracking device on **Skol** but has not yet determined what to do with it. Meanwhile, it sends a beacon to Gideon the Gray.
* Skol is dying.
* Skol has attuned to [The Shadow Wood Staff](/05-items/umbral-staff)

# Strong start

* The party has discovered a tracking device on Skol but has not yet determined what to do with it. Meanwhile, it sends a beacon to Gideon the Gray.
* The party is wanted for the assassination of Taria Gannin and perhaps also Jindri Messina.
    * Can Kuma help the party? Where is she?
    * If the party finds Kuma and raises Jindri, would Jindri exonerate them, or at least corroborate their story about Ter'rambla?
    * The Tarukai and the Shiyadim are hunting The Strangers, so Ethewa is extremely dangerous for them.

# Scenes

* Dareel advises the party to stick to the forests and low for a bit. Right now, Lloth'Ivan has the fear and grief of the clans on his side. The longer the party lays low, the harder it will be for him to continue to expend so much effort hunting you. But if he finds you, or even can show credible evidence of you, he will gain strength. Not only in Ethewa, but beyond, even to Mar'Illith.
* **Argento** would not leave and would chase off anyone who tried to encourage him otherwise. Except for one migrant druid who reeks of the wild. Him Argento seems to have taken a liking to. It is Pel Grim, the Droughtwalker. When Wangari goes to Argento and re-unite with him, Pel Grim is there.
* **Steam** has not yet had the chance to investigate the box from Petro Arnogast.
* **Skol**'s spell scroll is probably [Shadow Realm Gateway](http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:shadow-realm-gateway). The spell scroll allows him to enter the Shadow realm, but the danger is unimaginable.
* **Wangari** is going to [Commune with the Undine](/02-players/wangari#enhanceddivinesense):
    * "Sister who walks on land. Flow with us. . . open your mind so that we can see as you and also see what perhaps you did not. Let our knowledge inform your memory."
    * "Kobra is not the first dragon you've encountered. Dragons have not been seen in Ethewa for millennia, yet you have now seen two, one of them who still lives!
    * Dragons are powerful on their own. As avatars they can become unstoppable. If Kobra had come through, returned to Erith and corrupted in Shadow -> DISASTER!
    * And what then of Kai'Pow'eh? They are already here. What if they become an avatar of Shadow?
* **Dunbar** is going to cast Augury. 
    * Learns that the constellations move as per normal, but on rare occasions they move in strange, erratic ways.
    * Sees these figures—Chariot, Death, the Fool, Hermit.
        * Kima: weal
        * Scar: woe
        * Nor'andil: weal
        * Ethewa'dan: woe
        * Ursa: weal/woe

# Secrets and clues

* The hearth forges at Kima enhance weapons/armor. They are highly sought after by high-end weaponsmiths.
* The banes are the product of periods when creative magic is suppressed/deficient.
* The banes make Erith vulnerable to shadow.
* The great tree network is under attack. Strange reports about them are starting to surface. This is a vector through which the Shadow can infect all of Erith.
Gideon is hunting/tracking the party.
* The Gloomvale and Scar were encroaching but stopped. . . when the party defeated the Kobra and the shadow she carried.
* Ido Wenda took some hairs discovered at the scene and compared them to samples she recovers from her cabin when she remembers she hosted the party there. Obviously, they are a match—Skol's beard.
* Llot'Ivan has sent a fellowship to Mar'illith for help, to recruit against the shadow—their reaction is uncertain. Who is Rangewarden of Ethewa now? Will they deal without one?
* Everyone is questioning the absence of kai, even the White Sun, who in some ways are pleased, since they have no love for the gods. However, there is also concern about their truce with the gods— will this lead to instability for them? What is coming at the next Droughtbane?

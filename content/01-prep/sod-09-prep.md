# A Calling of the Clans

## Strong Start

## Scenes

* The party spots Aritrix at a distance. If they attempt to engage her she flees.
* Graegon Fletcher is challenged to a duel by a pair of Kobra'kai monks who taunt him mercilessly into a wild chase across the tent-tops of the camp, ultimately leading him to an introduction with a 4th degree Kobra'kai.
    * What is the taunt?
    * Not a real monk. If you're a monk, where are your brothers and sisters. Where is your master?
    * How to run the chase? Same format as The Chase.
        * Base speed on movement speed. The kid mond
* Wangari summons a warhorse that turns out to be a chem.
* Wangari encounters Lo'Kumi'Kai. Lo wants the fiery paladin to bring the scrying water to Lo's sister, who has beein meditating in the Ean'del cistern, deep below the Ethewa'dan, for decades. Lo wants her sister to absorb the water and attune to the scrying. If she does this, the Kumi'Kai will discover that the party has unleashed the Shadow on Erath.
    * How do they find Lo'Kumi'Kai in her tent?
    * What does she say
        * Wangari—recognize her strength, criticize her empty fury, challenge her to do *something*.
        * Skol—recognize his ambition, criticize his lack of curiosity about where he got his power, does he not wonder the price, does he not wonder why he did not grow sick like Dhenn?
        * Steam—grant him his 'youth', chastise his oath to Shayel, which he made in ignorance and duress, but has had so little curiosity to complete. If he is wrongly engaged, then quit, but regardless, if he remains engaged, then step up and do it. Do you even know what your quest is? What it means?
        * Take it to my sister, who sleeps in the Ean'del cistri. I cannot tell you how to get in to her, but once there do not tarry. She has slept long, and she will be hungry.



* Steam is lead around and teased by thieving kids. If he follows, they lead him to the tinker/armorer/smith district to an old tinker, actually a discredited Artificer who doesn't know a thing about Steam's sword but who does recognize the Autarch's runes on his armor. He tells Steam that he does not think he is a construct at all.
    * Artificer Ellek the Odd. Prodigy destined for greatness but fell when his own hubris led him to steal something from a dead god/angel, or perhaps he has somehow been to Carin'del.
    * While Ellek plays as though he knows nothing about the sword at first, he knows more than he lets on. He avoids looking at it too intently, detect with a DC 15 Insight check.
    * He is confused about Steam's origin, because although he looks like an extremely advanced Chem (suggesting an origin in some lost civilization far in Erath's past), Steam's sword is from another world. 
    * Perhaps Steam isn't an advanced chem from some prior civilization but a race from another world who came to Erath, and some *other* civilization created chems in his image!
    * If so, perhaps Steam isn't a chem after all but some alien race wearing armor he does not know how to remove. Perhaps he was intentionally imprisoned.
    * The Artificer muses that perhaps there is magic that can send this sword home and, perhaps, Steam with it so that he could discover his origin.
    * 
* Skol sees Dhenn out of the corner of his eye. He starts seeing him repeatedly, everywhere, taunting him. Dhenn is a shapeshifter.

## Possible Encounters

### On the Road

* **Squad of Beli and Gh'eena from Mor'dani**, skirmishing into the Ethe'watch!?!
* **Taru'kai patrol**, though typically only 1-2 rangers, occasionally accompanied by 2-4 initiates from the academy.
* **Kyode pack**. These large canoid predators are prowling the watch as well, the first to come up down out of the mountains in anticipation of droughtbreak. There is a chance they are discovered feeding. Regardless, the pack will regard the party warily but will not attack without provocation. A kill here will earn the deep distrust of the Kyo'dir. There is a d6! chance that they are accompanied by a long kyodir.
* **Straggler merchant pilgrims**, often Ethewa goblyns, making the long journey from the grasslands that lie just east of the Danosi ranges. They would have passed Ter'rambla while the party was inside or still on their way there. They may have strange items (or info) to sell. They will also buy artifacts, particularly those imbued with magic.
* **Ethewa land healers**. Nomadic druids and mages returning from the south to answer the call.
* **A patch of corrupted silver drought blooms**. On closer inspection, some appear to be infected with some sort of fungus. Make some saving throw to avoid provoking a Gloomflower attack.
* **A clutch of dusk raptors**. Greg might remember that the feathers of a dusk raptor could be used to enhance his spear. Could they help to repair it?

### The Campgrounds

### Inside Ethewa'dan

## Focus NPCs

These are the important characters for this session.

### Agith Endl

* Female, Ylve, **Head Arcanist**, clan Ethe'An'dil. Agith is sworn to the Ethe'watch, but her passion is the search for knowledge and the pursuit of power. Her ambitions are not political, though. 

* For Agith, arcane secrets open up a true understanding of reality. And the greater the power harnessed, the more there is to learn, she believes.

* And as each new arcane secret obtained expands one's wisdom and knowledge, the need to draw on those arcane powers fades.

* But until then. . . one does what one must.


### Dhenn

* Young male danosi goblin, store keep at Ter'rambla. Infected by a shadow ooze that is gestating within, Dhenn joined the party briefly. 

* When the party found the Great Room at Ter'rambla and defeated Maw and Paw, they brought Dhenn to the Great Tree. 
    
* There he meditated while the party searched the area, encountered phase spiders, etc. 

* The party left Dhenn meditating alone in the Great Room while they took a short rest in the storeroom. While meditating, Dhenn established contact with the Great Tree network.

* The connection allowed the shadow energy in Dhenn to inject a piece of itself into the network. 

* While this Shadowir (literally "shadow virus") is unlikely to have poisoned the entire network, it has allowed the shadow to affect some trees (think of immune reactions). 

* Some forrests are decimated almost immediately and completely. A few terrible but rare others become corrupted and consumed into the Shadowir themselves.

* Dhenn will be among the forces that plies Skol to murder Taria. Dhenn plays their common bond in Shadow against Skol. Perhaps he offers Skol the chance to free himself of Shadow if he just does this one deed. Or if not, maybe the lure is more power and a great name among his house.

### Ged Straw

* Male Ylve, **Chief Agriculturist**, Ethe'Shiro'kai. He is also a monk who studied with Kobra'Kai, literally "The Grace of the Flowing Serpent." Corpulent but incredibly strong for his age. Very intelligent but quiet, always listening. 

* Ged cannot see with his eyes but has some magic/tech that grants him **Blindsight**. He is in tune with deep time.

* Ged became blindsighted when he was 16: "The thing most folks don't reckon about blindsight is that I have a full 360-degree field of view," he says, smiling. Then soberly: "It completely rewires your brain. I can see everything at once. And I can react to it, too. Everything. All of it at once, in unison. It is why I am a good shepherd. And it makes me a valuable ally, particularly in tense times like these." 

### Lloth'Ivan

* Male Ylve, Herdsward, **First Heart of Shaya'dim (Assassins)**, Ethe'Noran'dil. Ivan believes that the Shaya'dim are fated to save all of Ethe'wa and even Kai herself. 

* Literally "Gift from the Gods," members of the Shaya'dim assassins are regarded by their fellow clanspeople coolly but with respect. The assassins have not been called to action in centuries, but they are always vigilant. 

* The Assassins are trained to discover ways their target is stalked by Death and then tease those threads into being.

* As times grow darker with the arrival of the Shadowir (and the party), Ivan becomes ever more convinced that their hour is at hand.


* His assassins are out patrolling the Ethe'watch, perhaps not at the range of the Taru'kai, but when encountered, they tend to be much less forgiving of strangers and far easier to provoke.

### Lo'Kumi'Kai

* **Celestial river squid** spawned centuries ago in Silvan'dir. She has been living in the Stren'dil and arrives to the Calling with the Ylves of Streya on Stren'dil, who have escorted her among their caravan. 

* Meanwhile, throughout the Ethe'watch her brothers and sisters sleep deep below the dry beds of the rivers Kai, swaddled in cocoons of mud. 

* A few others mediate in the still caverns beneath the Mor'dani. There they dwell on their spiritual connection to one another and to all of the waters of Urith. In this way, they also have access to the Great Tree network.

* Lo'Kumi herself has come to meditate within the cistern of Ean'dil, which lies deep in below Ethewa'an. She and her siblings perceive Kai as an undine, and they believe she was created in their image.

* Lo'Kumi is extremely intelligent, with little sense of humor and a ravenous apetite. Because of the profusion of stimuli her molluscan mind receives from the environment, she can often seem distracted. In reality, she is weighing a much larger field of space and time that most humanoids can imagine.

* When she speaks telepathically, her voice is perceived as a slow silky whisper that just barely rasps when she is angry.

* If the party discover or impress her before she enters the Ean'del, Lo'Kumi would have words with them. Kumi's sisters and brothers have picked up signs of something prowling at the edges of the Great Trees. Kumi is also aware of the Jorem giants and of Greentide in particular.

### Merghenn Dorien

* Male, Ylve, **Master Artisan**, himself an expert Artificer. 

### Taria Gannin

### Mamho Gannin

## From last time

Important stuff to keep in mind or memorialize from the last session(s):

* Fragments of Jindri's letter
* Dhenn disappeared
* Skol took samples from the Great Tree
    * Pale slender-stalked mushroom with a broad delicate cap of dramatic proportion but with a noxious smell.
    * Yellow-green moss obtained from a colony draped from a low-hanging bough.
    * An orchid-like plant, in vibrant purples, greens, and blacks, the petals mottled in exotic patterns like those of an octopus's chromatophores.
    * A bright orange lichen that reacts to the presence of fell substances—shadow, for example.
* The party met a water drake, who climbed out of a well moments, it seems, after her creation. This the drake who will become _**Kara'kai'Poweyh**_—Kai's dragon Poweyh.


## Background NPCs

### Taru'kai patrols

As Ethe'wa prepares for Droughtbreak amid uncertainty and a growing shadow, Taria has put the Taru'kai out on double watches to protect not only Ethewa'dan but the clans that make the Ethe'wa nation itself.

Taru'kai patrols are small and lightly armored. They are built for speed and stealth. Each consists of 1-2 of Taru-kai rangers (CR d4+2) any animal companions (d6! for the presence of a Kyodir), as well as d4 initiates (CR2).

_**Trastion (Swiftblade)**_ Male. Bald head, gray eyes, soft black skin. Very short and stout, with an oval ordinary face. Aggressive but calm. Pragmatic and resourceful, uncomfortable in urban settings. Skeptical of Kai's absence, Trastion will revere whatever deity is most helpful to Ethewa at the given moment. Trastion has a long lost daughter, but his distaste for civilization has stopped him from finding her.

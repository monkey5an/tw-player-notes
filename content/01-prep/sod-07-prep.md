# Return to Ethewa'dan

## Strong Start

## Scenes

* ** Meeting Jindri.** Dunbar spills into the air pocket at the base of the stairs down in Ter'rambla. She lies slumped on floor against the north wall of the hallway. Will the party have the smarts to take her corpse back to Ethewa'dan so that she can be resurrected.

## NPCs

### Key callouts

* **Dhenn.** Young male danosi goblin, store keep at Ter'rambla.

* **Lloth'Ivan**, male Ylve, Herdsward, **First Heart of Shaya'dim (Assassins)**. Literally "Gift from the Gods." Their fellow clanspeople regard them coolly but with respect. They have not been called to action in centuries, but they are always vigilant. The Assassins are trained to discover ways their target is stalked by Death and then tease those threads into being.

* **Ged Straw**, male Ylve, **Chief Agriculturist**. Corpulent but incredibly strong for his age. Very intelligent but quiet, always listening. He cannot see with his eyes but has some magic/tech that grants him **Blindsight**. He is in tune with deep time.

* **Agith Endl**, female, Ylve, **Head Arcanist**.

* **The Danosi.** Largely familial clan of humanoids, similar to human near relatives, **Denisova hominins**—squat, wide faces with large, almond shaped eyes. Short, typically less than 5' tall. The Danosi tend the Gend'awa tree at Ter'rambla. 

    Theirs were also the number who shadowed the party and subsequently scattered. It is rare that they would come north at all, let alone this far. 
    
    They despise the Mor'dani, where they believe a malevolent god has come and even now builds itself a throne. It is a subject of slightly more than friendly tension between Ido and Gherin, the master spirit healer at Ter'rambla.
* **Mer'ghenn Dorien**, male, Ylve, **Master Artisan**, himself an expert Artificer. 

### From last time

* Fragments of Jindri's letter
* Dhenn disappeared
* Skol took samples from the Great Tree
    * Pale slender-stalked mushroom with a broad delicate cap of dramatic proportion but with a noxious smell.
    * Yellow-green moss obtained from a colony draped from a low-hanging bough.
    * An orchid-like plant, in vibrant purples, greens, and blacks, the petals mottled in exotic patterns like those of an octopus's chromatophores.
    * A bright orange lichen that reacts to the presence of fell substances—shadow, for example.
* The party met a water drake, who climbed out of a well moments, it seems, after her creation. This the drake who will become _**Kara'kai**_—Kai's dragon

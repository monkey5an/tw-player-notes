When the party exit the floodgate, they will almost certainly emerge through the massive door at the end of the floodplain and out the northwestern face of Ethewa'dan beneath the towering peaks that are home to the ***White Sun Oruks***. 

They will also be able to see the line of the still empty riverbed to the north, where Ethewa prepare for the rising of the waters.

Unbeknownst to them, when the party emerge from Ean'del, they are **fugitives**. 

Depending on when they emerge, they may already be suspected of Taria's assassination.

# Last session

* The Sword of Vengeance has [drowned](/02-players/steam).
* Both Kuma & Xien stress the importance that no one discover the party were in Ean'del. The stress on the relationship between the Lo'kai and the Ethewa might not bear the strain. (There are those—Lloth'Ivan, for one, who do not like the fey creature in their holiest body of water, not with the drought banes rising in intensity and Kai nowhere to be found.)
* When the party retraces their steps to leave, they will realize they can't likely go back the way they came—for one thing, it's not clear _how_ to reopen the magical door through which they entered. And, even if they did, they risk being seen re-appearing in the Great Hall. It'd be much more difficult to explain coming out than going in.
* Thus circumstance and events conspire to push the party out through the flood plains, which could be home to any manner of carrion creatures—much fewer in number this late in a drought unless, perhaps, the coming Droughtbreak is causing them to return/rise from their hibernation.

# Murder in Ethewa'dan

While the party have been wading deep below, dark deeds are afoot in Ethewa'dan.

Taria Gannin has disappeared and foul play is suspected.

Lloth'Ivan urges The Council to activate the Shaya'dim (Assassins). After a contentious debate and a narrow vote, The Council agrees —the first council in centuries to have done so.

The Taru'kai confirm that the Strangers have been seen in Ethewa and that they arrived shortly before Taria was last seen.

The Council puts out a **warrant for The Strangers**.

What they **do not yet know** is that Taria Gannin has been assassinated:

* The body is discovered sometime in the next 3 hours.
* The evidence will point toward ***Skol Frostguard***.

> ### Dramatic question: An alibi worth having?
> When the party emerge, they are wanted by The Council, perhaps for murder, and the Shaya'dim are eager to find them.
>
> This presents a real conundrum for the party —they have an alibi, but their alibi is also a crime, and if they confess it, they will not only betray the Sisters of the Undine, they also risk rupturing the alliance between the Sisters and the Ethewa.

# A Kobra'kai welcome

When [the party exits the floodgate](/01-prep/sod-12-prep), they are surrounded by a band of monks, as evidenced by their dress and arms. A member of the band speaks to chastise the two young monks Graegon recognizes from the night before. 

He then turns and speaks to Graegon in draconic. The tone of his greeting is cordial. The rest of the party hear the name "Kobra'kai." After introductions, the leader adds something with an air of menace.

This band is far more serious than the young initiates who teased fletch at the Calling, through they are here as well.

Their leader apprises the party of their situation with The council, and his impulse is to turn The Strangers in, particularly the dwarven wizard (Skol) and the tiefling assassin (Oisin).

But the presence of Graegon Fletcher changes everything. Clearly the leader did not expect the report of the younger monks to be true—yet now standing before him is a strange monk arrived from another world, a ***dragonborn*** no less. Could the [Kobra'kai prophecy](/02-players/graegon) be true?

# A shared flight

Dareel, the leader of this Kobra band knows that the Shaya'dim assassins and the Taru'kai rangeward are both going to be looking for the Party soon. 

If Graegon accepts the challenge, the Kobra will see the Party to safety—they have a small temple to the northwest, at the foot of the Mor'dani range. They can rest safely there—it is to the north and closer to the wastes—their pursuers will not think to follow you there.

> "Even the arcanists do not have the key to this temple, Dareel smiles confidently."

If they do not, the Kobra band will attempt to capture the Party with the intention of turning them in—the Kobra are loyal Ethewa after all—and they will fight the party if necessary.

Given the time pressure, the Party will have to make a decision quickly. This means leaving immediately, without their belongings, and without going back to camp. If the party can persuade Dareel (DC 20), he will let two party members escorted by three Kobra return to the camp to reconnoiter.

> ### Decision time: Kobra'kai
>
> The party has three options here:
>
> 1. The party decides to go with the Kobra'kai—go to [*Graegon's challenge*](/02-players/graegon).
> 1. The party agrees but persuade Dareel to let them go to camp first—see [*Meanwhile, at the Calling*](#meanwhile,atthecalling), below.
> 1. The party refuses to go with the Kobra'kai—roll initiative and fight it out in [*Graegon's challenge*](/02-players/graegon/#akobra'kaichallenge).

# Meanwhile, at the Calling

## Kuma: Forced to flee

News of Taria's assassination prompts Kuma to leave Ethewa'dan, much against her wishes — yet under the circumstances she (and the Sisters) see little choice:

* With Taria gone and instability brewing in Ethewa'dan, especially the sway of Lloth'Ivan over the Council and the activation of the shaya'dim — it is not safe for Kuma to linger.
* This is compounded by the fact suspicion is turning toward the strangers — if Lloth'Ivan discovers that Kuma made a clandestine pact with The Strangers to break into Ean'del, the Ethewa could very well view that as an act of treachery against their alliance.
* Not to mention the fact that the plan appropriated holy scrying water bestowed to Jindri — that's not only treachery, it is espionage.
- And then there is the problem of Jindri's corpse in Kuma's tent — that incriminates them all in assassination — an act of war!

## Clans: Called home

Much of the clans at the Calling have left or sent their families home to prepare defenses for what they believe is a war coming, though many are not sure who their enemy will be.

These folks have left behind contingents of **political** and **martial** folk. They remain behind to sereve two purposes — one overt, one covert:

* **[Overt]** Support the defense of Ethewa'Dan and the choosing of a new Rangewarden.
* **[Covert]** Keep an eye on the Council and Lloth'Ivan in particular, of whom some are now openly suspiciious, many more so, privately.

A few of the clans have also left behind to collect intelligence. These folk stay behind in no formal role. They appear to be support staff, or even a family. They have two missions:
* **Spies** — Keep tabs on the other clans and collect information.
* **Scouts** — Skirmish near the border with the Wastes searching for signs of the Shadow.

## Petro Arnogast: Lost or found?

Petro has remained behind, or at least his wagon has. In fact, his wagon appears to have been completely ransacked and abandoned. What happened here?

> ### Toss the cobbler
>
> The tinker's wagon is in disarray because Petro did so before he left. What better way to secure something than make it appear like it has no value?
>
> Detect the ruse with Investigation (DC 20) or via magical tinkering (or some other means that requires Steam).

Check out the tinker's wagon puzzle — perhaps Arnogast has also fled but left his wagon behind with a message for Steam.

He may also have left a specific message:

> "Before you can learn about your armor, you must understand your tools and skills. Bring these three keys into harmony. Only then will they reveal their secret."

To solve this riddle, Steam must use his Magical Tinkering feature to set each of the three keys ringing at a different pitch so that together they play a chord.

# Focus NPCs

These are the important characters for this session.

## Dareel

* Male goblyn [Kobra'kai brother](https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/monkeysan/characters/42308866).

## Lloth'Ivan

* Male Ylve, Herdsward, **First Heart of Shaya'dim (Assassins)**, Ethe'Noran'dil. Ivan believes that the Shaya'dim are fated to save all of Ethe'wa and even Kai herself. 
* Literally "Gift from the Gods," members of the Shaya'dim assassins are regarded by their fellow clanspeople coolly but with respect. The assassins have not been called to action in centuries, but they are always vigilant. 
* The Assassins are trained to discover ways their target is stalked by Death and then tease those threads into being.
* As times grow darker with the arrival of the Shadowir (and the party), Ivan becomes ever more convinced that their hour is at hand.
* His assassins are out patrolling the Ethe'watch, perhaps not at the range of the Taru'kai, but when encountered, they tend to be much less forgiving of strangers and far easier to provoke.

## Lokuma'kai

* **Celestial river squid** spawned centuries ago in Silvan'dir. She has been living in the Stren'dil and arrives to the Calling with the Ylves of Streya on Stren'dil, who have escorted her among their caravan. 
* Meanwhile, throughout the Ethe'watch her brothers and sisters sleep deep below the dry beds of the rivers Kai, swaddled in cocoons of mud. 
* A few others mediate in the still caverns beneath the Mor'dani. There they dwell on their spiritual connection to one another and to all of the waters of Urith. In this way, they also have access to the Great Tree network.
* Lo'Kumi herself has come to meditate within the cistern of Ean'dil, which lies deep in below Ethewa'an. She and her siblings perceive Kai as an undine, and they believe she was created in their image.
* Lo'Kumi is extremely intelligent, with little sense of humor and a ravenous apetite. Because of the profusion of stimuli her molluscan mind receives from the environment, she can often seem distracted. In reality, she is weighing a much larger field of space and time that most humanoids can imagine.
* When she speaks telepathically, her voice is perceived as a slow silky whisper that just barely rasps when she is angry.
* If the party discover or impress her before she enters the Ean'del, Lo'Kumi would have words with them. Kumi's sisters and brothers have picked up signs of something prowling at the edges of the Great Trees. Kumi is also aware of the Jorem giants and of Greentide in particular.

## Loxien'kai

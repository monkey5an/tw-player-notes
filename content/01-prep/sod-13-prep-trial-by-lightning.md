When the party exit the floodgate, they will almost certainly emerge through the massive door at the end of the floodplain and out the northwestern face of Ethewa'dan beneath the towering peaks that are home to the ***White Sun Oruks***. 

They will also be able to see the line of the still-empty riverbed to the north, where Ethewa prepare for the rising of the waters.

Unbeknownst to them, when the party emerge from Ean'del, they are **fugitives**. 

Depending on when they emerge, they may already be suspected of Taria's assassination.

# Last session

* After exiting Ean'del floodgate, the Kobra'kai monks ambush the party and make a deal with Graegon.
* Speaking with Kobra'kai daiko Dareel, in draconic, Graegon learns that the monks are awestruck by him and believe fletch—the Stranger monk—is the subject of their prophecy, about the children of a blue dragon returning to Erath.

# Tonight

* You all are really becoming good, both as players and a party.
* You've all started to embrace your characters. We've set the stage.
* So tonight we're going to ditch the training wheels.
* Now you're Level 8 and shit's gonna get real, both in Erath and the game.

# Graegon fights solo

* Before the fight begins, someone in the party may notice (Perception DC 15) that two of the Kobra'kai have left.

## Fletch flashes back

* During the trial fights, at key dramatic moments where he is hurt, he has flashbacks to killing his brothers in rage.
* When he deals damage, he has flashbacks of being called "It" and treated like an animal in the years before he was befriended by his master.
* Also, at some point during the trial, but before the match with Dareel, the scouts return and whisper something to him that greatly upsets the Kobra'daiko—it is news that Taria Gannin is dead and that evidence was found that points to The Strangers, Skol in particular.

## Drought breaks

* Dunbar senses it.
* Skol recoils from it.
* BOOM — from out in the Mor'dani Wastes
    * Thereafter, Graegon can use a bonus action to phase out of time
    * The phasing moves him back and forth between the Kobra'kai and Kobra's ghost—when he is not with the party and Kobra, Graegon is back fighting Dareel, and he must accept a blow from his future brother to return. 
    * In fact, while he is in phase with Dareel, he can ask questions of lore that could help him tactically with the fight.

## The trial ends

* Even in his defeat, Dareel is pleased to no end by Graegon's performance.

# Kobra rising

Kobra is the ghost of a 16th level young [adult blue dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-blue-dragon).

* Spell save DC = 15
* Armor class AC = 18
* To hit bonus = +8
* Breath weapon:
    * DEX 15
    * 3d10 lightning
* The party's Hero's Feast from Loxien'kai does not prevent frightening from Kobra, but it does mitigate it after one turn—"The echo of Loxien'kai steels your courage as the Comfort of Undine washes over you."
* Perhaps Kobra cannot be defeated while Graegon is out of phase with her.
* Dareel senses what is going on, and he may place the sash of his monk skirt on Graegon
    * This could give Graegon an ability from Way of the Cobalt Hand, such as Extract Aspects
    * This could grant some other ability.

## The crone returns

* [Oisin](/02-players/oisin) senses the old crone
* Her tattoo arm hurts
* The crone has a part of what comes next — the coming of the ghost of Kobra.
* Kobra returns and gives a speech to Graegon. It is a speech of love and hope, but it also demands trial by combat. Kobra challenges Graegon alone to see what his companions will do (it is a test).

## A new trial begins

* The party will lkely lose to Kobra so feel free to really test them.
* Hiding behind pillars protects from breath weapon.

## The judging

* Kobra judges the party based on how they fight for each other:
    * If they lose, wake up in Dareel's care some days later.
    * If they defeat Kobra, give them a shadiphid. Let them return home if they want—maybe even end the campaign. . . then pull them back to Erath.

# Questions

* What is in Steam's box?
* At some point, Dendra—the [Kobra'kai](/02-players/graegon#thekobra'kai) monk that dislikes [Oisin](/02-players/oisin) because she is wearing the shoes of a goblyn isquero—rummages through the party's gear and discovers 
    * Jindri's journal
    * the copy of the Engineering map Graegon stole from interns (and brothers) Dulstn and Holstern.
* The discovery confirms Dedra's suspicion, and she confronts Oisin with it.
* The reckoning forces the party to acknowledge their theft of artifacts, brings Jindri back into the picture, and reminds them of Jindri's plea to find her daughter.
* ***What if***—the map of artifact sites forms a shape of the Hierophant, each site being from a different age of Erath, though they all have the Hierophant in common. And it turns out the Hierophant is not a consciousness as much as a pattern of relationships or a network. . . like the Great Trees.
* The Great Trees are infected. This news is corroborated by Pel'Grim who comes to the Kobra'kai temple.

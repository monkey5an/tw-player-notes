# Unexpected visitors and a counsel in Ethewa'dan

## Strong Start

The **Ido Wenda** hosts the party at the **Watchwright's Cabin** with the intention of leading them to **Ethewa'dan** the following morning. During the night, the party receive **a series of unexpected visitors**.

## Scenes

* The party travels with Wenda to her cabin.

* **Wenda wants the party to continue with her to Ethewa'dan** so that they can tell the Council what they have seen. 

* **When they arrive, Ido mutters "I expect will have some company this evening,"** chuckling ruefully to herself (Perception DC 15). Wenda then casts a spell (***clairvoyance***) on a small object she places at the top of the hill. The image is projected magically from here and displays on the rear wall of the cabin.

* **The first visit—a Kai'lifa avatar in the form of an otter.** Graegon's staff of warning alerts him (and Aritrix) to a creature approaching stealthily up on the hill above the Watchwright's cabin. They see a creature standing before the sensor. 

    It is an otter who stares right into the sensor and into the cabin, as though she can see through it. Such a strange guest in a region without water. She interacts vaguely and cleverly with the pair but disappears before anyone else can see. Kai'lifa, patron Tender of the Ethewa.

* **The second visit.** A Dansosi band arrives expecting answers from the Party and only just barely holding off attack by virtue of Ido's presence. If the tense moment is broken with violence, Ido shouts to the party not to kill anyone.

* **The third visit.** A shadowir scouting party.

## Ido Wenda

### About

**Ido Wenda, Ethe'Watchwright.** Wenda is burly old woman named Ido. she studies "magic," surveys the ward, and smokes too much. she is  friendly to those she knows,  gruff to those she doesn't. An honest woman and a good teacher. In her youth there was no one in the valleys who could best her on the river.

* If anyone in the party uses _Create or Destroy Water_, or any other spell that summons water, Ido will be gravely offended. Water magic draws on existing pools. It does not create it out of nothing. That is because it is not simply water. But that is another story. 

* So when the party uses water magic, they are drawing on clan reserves without permission. Because they are near Danosi land, Ido is even more deeply offended, since the party is her guest. She is responsible for their behavior.

    From this point forward, Wenda will show her gruff side, permanently alienated from the caster.

### Quotes & Stuff

* There are some whose loyalty to themselves is greater than their loyalty to Erath.

* **If asked about Shayel.** This world, Erath, has seen many ages, and she has buried all of them eventually. There are stories of course, that tell of places where the memory of ages past comes to life. Perhaps your Shayel was among them? Perhaps if you remembered more about her?

* **About the paradox of the Autarch's Tomb.** If what you say is true, about coming through a portal from another world, perhaps you arrived at another time as well . . . Ido laughs.

    I mean dimensional magic is one thing, planar magic another. But what you describe—that is . . . trans-universal magic. Magic that works anywhere, completely independent of its environment. How astonishing. If true. hmm.
    
    And if one can do that . . . if another universe can even theoretically exist, then why not time travel as well! Nasal laugh.

    Or perhaps you are ghosts. Though you certainly look noting like anything that has died on this Erath.

### Encounters

* Ido shows Skol how to craft a spell book. But he requires ink from Agith Endl, and she does not give the good stuff up cheaply.

## NPCs

* **Agith Endl**—

* **The Danosi.** Largely familial clan of humanoids, similar to human near relatives, Denisova hominins—squat, wide faces with large, almond shaped eyes. Short, typically less than 5' tall. The Danosi tend the Gend'awa tree at Ter'rambla. 

    Theirs were also the number who shadowed the party and subsequently scattered. It is rare that they would come north at all, let alone this far. 
    
    They despise the Mor'dani, where they believe a malevolent god has come and even now builds itself a throne. It is a subject of slightly more than friendly tension between Ido and Gherin, the master spirit healer at Ter'rambla.

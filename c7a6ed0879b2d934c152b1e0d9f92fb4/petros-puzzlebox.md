*Wondrous item, unique*

---

This phenomenally strong box made of oiled hardwood is wrapped with pairs of simple but expertly inlaid bands of metal. The bands traverse the box and culminate in a ring on top. A rolled-up scroll of raw paper is nestled in the ring like a napkin.

The box appears to be without lid, hinge, lock, or seam. The faint smell of anise lingers on its surface.

The scroll, printed with blue-black letters inked with some sort of hand stamp, contains this message:

>"Before you can learn about your armor, you must understand your tools. As in all things, the key lies in harmony. Only thus will you reveal my gift." <br />  *—**A**rnogast*
>

### The gift

The puzzlebox contains Petro's gift to Steam—an [All-purpose Tool (+1)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/all-purpose-tool)

### Text Fragment

Among the items in Petro's puzzlebox is a scrap of paper that looks like a rubbing (or some other copy) made from an original manuscript. This page contains alchemical diagrams and text. Someone has drawn annotations connecting elements of the diagrams and select phrases in the text. The connections converge on a central annotation—'S.T.E.A.M.'
